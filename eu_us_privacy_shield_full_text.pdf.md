# ANNEX 1: Letter from Under Secretary for International Trade Stefan Selig

# ANNEX 2: Arbitral Model

## ANNEX I

This Annex I provides the terms under which Privacy Shield organizations are
obligated to arbitrate claims, pursuant to the Recourse, Enforcement and
Liability Principle. The binding arbitration option described below applies to
certain “residual” claims as to data covered by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. The
purpose of this option is to provide a prompt, independent, and fair mechanism,
at the option of individuals, for resolution of claimed violations of the
Principles not resolved by any of the other Privacy Shield mechanisms, if any.

### A. Scope

This arbitration option is available to an individual to determine, for
residual claims, whether a Privacy Shield organization has violated its
obligations under the Principles as to that individual, and whether any such
violation remains fully or partially unremedied. This option is available only
for these purposes. This option is not available, for example, with respect to
the exceptions to the Principles[^1] or with respect to an allegation about the
adequacy of the Privacy Shield.

### B. Available Remedies

Under this arbitration option, the Privacy Shield Panel (consisting of one or
three arbitrators, as agreed by the parties) has the authority to impose
individual-specific, non-monetary equitable relief (such as access, correction,
deletion, or return of the individual’s data in question) necessary to remedy
the violation of the Principles only with respect to the individual. These are
the only powers of the arbitration panel with respect to remedies. In
considering remedies, the arbitration panel is required to consider other
remedies that already have been imposed by other mechanisms under the Privacy
Shield. No damages, costs, fees, or other remedies are available.  Each party
bears its own attorney’s fees.

### C. Pre-Arbitration Requirements

An individual who decides to invoke this arbitration option must take the
following steps prior to initiating an arbitration claim: (1) raise the claimed
violation directly with the organization and afford the organization an
opportunity to resolve the issue within the timeframe set forth in Section
III.11(d)(i) of the Principles; (2) make use of the independent recourse
mechanism under the Principles, which is at no cost to the individual; and (3)
raise the issue through their Data Protection Authority to the Department of
Commerce and afford the Department of Commerce an opportunity to use best
efforts to resolve the issue within the timeframes set forth in the Letter from
the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce, at no
cost to the individual.  This arbitration option may not be invoked if the
individual’s same claimed violation of the Principles (1) has previously been
subject to binding arbitration; (2) was the subject of a final judgment entered
in a court action to which the individual was a party; or (3) was previously
settled by the parties. In addition, this option may not be invoked if an EU
Data Protection Authority (1) has authority under Sections III.5 or III.9 of
the Principles; or (2) has the authority to resolve the claimed violation
directly with the organization. A DPA’s authority to resolve the same claim
against an EU data controller does not alone preclude invocation of this
arbitration option against a different legal entity not bound by the DPA
authority.

[^1]: Section I.5 of the Principles.

### D. Binding Nature of Decisions

An individual’s decision to invoke this binding arbitration option is entirely
voluntary. Arbitral decisions will be binding on all parties to the
arbitration. Once invoked, the individual forgoes the option to seek relief for
the same claimed violation in another forum, except that if nonmonetary
equitable relief does not fully remedy the claimed violation, the individual’s
invocation of arbitration will not preclude a claim for damages that is
otherwise available in the courts.

### E. Review and Enforcement

Individuals and Privacy Shield organizations will be able to seek judicial review and
enforcement of the arbitral decisions pursuant to U.S. law under the Federal Arbitration Act.2
Any such cases must be brought in the federal district court whose territorial coverage includes
the primary place of business of the Privacy Shield organization.

Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) provides that “[a]n arbitration agreement or arbitral
award arising out of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, which is considered as commercial,
including a transaction, contract, or agreement described in [section 2 of the FAA], falls under the
Convention [on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of June 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T.
2519, T.I.A.S. No. 6997 (“New York Convention”)].” 9 U.S.C. § 202. The FAA further provides that
“[a]n agreement or award arising out of such a relationship which is entirely between citizens of the
United States shall be deemed not to fall under the [New York] Convention unless that relationship
involves property located abroad, envisages performance or enforcement abroad, or has some other
reasonable relation with one or more foreign states.” Id. Under Chapter 2, “any party to the arbitration
may apply to any court having jurisdiction under this chapter for an order confirming the award as against
any other party to the arbitration. The court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for
refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said [New York]
Convention.” Id. § 207. Chapter 2 further provides that “[t]he district courts of the United States . . .
shall have original jurisdiction over . . . an action or proceeding [under the New York Convention],
regardless of the amount in controversy.” Id. § 203.
Chapter 2 also provides that “Chapter 1 applies to actions and proceedings brought under this chapter to
the extent that chapter is not in conflict with this chapter or the [New York] Convention as ratified by the
United States.” Id. § 208. Chapter 1, in turn, provides that “[a] written provision in . . . a contract
evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out
of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in
writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or
refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity
for the revocation of any contract.” Id. § 2. Chapter 1 further provides that “any party to the arbitration
may apply to the court so specified for an order confirming the award, and thereupon the court must grant
such an order unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11 of
[the FAA].” Id. § 9.

This arbitration option is intended to resolve individual disputes, and arbitral decisions are not
intended to function as persuasive or binding precedent in matters involving other parties,
including in future arbitrations or in EU or U.S. courts, or FTC proceedings.

### F. The Arbitration Panel

The parties will select the arbitrators from the list of arbitrators discussed below.
Consistent with applicable law, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European
Commission will develop a list of at least 20 arbitrators, chosen on the basis of independence,
integrity, and expertise. The following shall apply in connection with this process:
Arbitrators:
(1) will remain on the list for a period of 3 years, absent exceptional circumstances or for cause,
renewable for one additional period of 3 years;
(2) shall not be subject to any instructions from, or be affiliated with, either party, or any Privacy
Shield organization, or the U.S., EU, or any EU Member State or any other governmental
authority, public authority, or enforcement authority; and
(3) must be admitted to practice law in the U.S. and be experts in U.S. privacy law, with
expertise in EU data protection law.
G.

Arbitration Procedures

Consistent with applicable law, within 6 months from the adoption of the adequacy decision, the
Department of Commerce and the European Commission will agree to adopt an existing, wellestablished set of U.S. arbitral procedures (such as AAA or JAMS) to govern proceedings before
the Privacy Shield Panel, subject to each of the following considerations:
1. An individual may initiate binding arbitration, subject to the pre-arbitration requirements
provision above, by delivering a “Notice” to the organization. The Notice shall contain a
summary of steps taken under Paragraph C to resolve the claim, a description of the alleged
violation, and, at the choice of the individual, any supporting documents and materials and/or
a discussion of law relating to the alleged claim.
2. Procedures will be developed to ensure that an individual’s same claimed violation does not
receive duplicative remedies or procedures.
3. FTC action may proceed in parallel with arbitration.
4. No representative of the U.S., EU, or any EU Member State or any other governmental
authority, public authority, or enforcement authority may participate in these arbitrations,
provided, that at the request of an EU individual, EU DPAs may provide assistance in the
preparation only of the Notice but EU DPAs may not have access to discovery or any other
materials related to these arbitrations.
5. The location of the arbitration will be the United States, and the individual may choose video
or telephone participation, which will be provided at no cost to the individual. In-person
participation will not be required.

6. The language of the arbitration will be English unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Upon
a reasoned request, and taking into account whether the individual is represented by an
attorney, interpretation at the arbitral hearing as well as translation of arbitral materials will
be provided at no cost to the individual, unless the panel finds that, under the circumstances
of the specific arbitration, this would lead to unjustified or disproportionate costs.
7. Materials submitted to arbitrators will be treated confidentially and will only be used in
connection with the arbitration.
8. Individual-specific discovery may be permitted if necessary, and such discovery will be
treated confidentially by the parties and will only be used in connection with the arbitration.
9. Arbitrations should be completed within 90 days of the delivery of the Notice to the
organization at issue, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
H.

Costs

Arbitrators should take reasonable steps to minimize the costs or fees of the arbitrations.
Subject to applicable law, the Department of Commerce will facilitate the establishment of a
fund, into which Privacy Shield organizations will be required to pay an annual contribution,
based in part on the size of the organization, which will cover the arbitral cost, including
arbitrator fees, up to maximum amounts (“caps”), in consultation with the European
Commission. The fund will be managed by a third party, which will report regularly on the
operations of the fund. At the annual review, the Department of Commerce and European
Commission will review the operation of the fund, including the need to adjust the amount of the
contributions or of the caps, and will consider, among other things, the number of arbitrations
and the costs and timing of the arbitrations, with the mutual understanding that there will be no
excessive financial burden imposed on Privacy Shield organizations. Attorney’s fees are not
covered by this provision or any fund under this provision.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

EU-U.S. Privacy Shield
Principles

 

EU-U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD FRAMEWORK PRINCIPLES
ISSUED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
I.

OVERVIEW
1.

While the United States and the European Union share the goal of enhancing
privacy protection for their citizens, the United States takes a different
approach to privacy from that taken by the European Union. The United
States uses a sectoral approach that relies on a mix of legislation, regulation,
and self-regulation. Given those differences and to provide organizations in
the United States with a reliable mechanism for personal data transfers to the
United States from the European Union while ensuring that EU data subjects
continue to benefit from effective safeguards and protection as required by
European legislation with respect to the processing of their personal data when
they have been transferred to non-EU countries, the Department of Commerce
is issuing these Privacy Shield Principles, including the Supplemental
Principles (collectively “the Principles”) under its statutory authority to foster,
promote, and develop international commerce (15 U.S.C. § 1512). The
Principles were developed in consultation with the European Commission, and
with industry and other stakeholders, to facilitate trade and commerce between
the United States and European Union. They are intended for use solely by
organizations in the United States receiving personal data from the European
Union for the purpose of qualifying for the Privacy Shield and thus benefitting
from the European Commission’s adequacy decision. The Principles do not
affect the application of national provisions implementing Directive 95/46/EC
(“the Directive”) that apply to the processing of personal data in the Member
States. Nor do the Principles limit privacy obligations that otherwise apply
under U.S. law.

2.

In order to rely on the Privacy Shield to effectuate transfers of personal data
from the EU, an organization must self-certify its adherence to the Principles
to the Department of Commerce (or its designee) (“the Department”). While
decisions by organizations to thus enter the Privacy Shield are entirely
voluntary, effective compliance is compulsory: organizations that self-certify
to the Department and publicly declare their commitment to adhere to the
Principles must comply fully with the Principles. In order to enter the Privacy
Shield, an organization must (a) be subject to the investigatory and
enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the
Department of Transportation or another statutory body that will effectively
ensure compliance with the Principles (other U.S. statutory bodies recognized
by the EU may be included as an annex in the future); (b) publicly declare its
commitment to comply with the Principles; (c) publicly disclose its privacy
policies in line with these Principles; and (d) fully implement them. An
organization’s failure to comply is enforceable under Section 5 of the Federal
Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts in or affecting
commerce (15 U.S.C. § 45(a)) or other laws or regulations prohibiting such
acts.

 

3.

The Department of Commerce will maintain and make available to the public
an authoritative list of U.S. organizations that have self-certified to the
Department and declared their commitment to adhere to the Principles (“the
Privacy Shield List”). Privacy Shield benefits are assured from the date that
the Department places the organization on the Privacy Shield List. The
Department will remove an organization from the Privacy Shield List if it
voluntarily withdraws from the Privacy Shield or if it fails to complete its
annual re-certification to the Department. An organization’s removal from the
Privacy Shield List means it may no longer benefit from the European
Commission’s adequacy decision to receive personal information from the
EU. The organization must continue to apply the Principles to the personal
information it received while it participated in the Privacy Shield, and affirm
to the Department on an annual basis its commitment to do so, for as long as it
retains such information; otherwise, the organization must return or delete the
information or provide “adequate” protection for the information by another
authorized means. The Department will also remove from the Privacy Shield
List those organizations that have persistently failed to comply with the
Principles; these organizations do not qualify for Privacy Shield benefits and
must return or delete the personal information they received under the Privacy
Shield.

4.

The Department will also maintain and make available to the public an
authoritative record of U.S. organizations that had previously self-certified to
the Department, but that have been removed from the Privacy Shield List.
The Department will provide a clear warning that these organizations are not
participants in the Privacy Shield; that removal from the Privacy Shield List
means that such organizations cannot claim to be Privacy Shield compliant
and must avoid any statements or misleading practices implying that they
participate in the Privacy Shield; and that such organizations are no longer
entitled to benefit from the European Commission’s adequacy decision that
would enable those organizations to receive personal information from the
EU. An organization that continues to claim participation in the Privacy
Shield or makes other Privacy Shield-related misrepresentations after it has
been removed from the Privacy Shield List may be subject to enforcement
action by the FTC, the Department of Transportation, or other enforcement
authorities.

5.

Adherence to these Principles may be limited: (a) to the extent necessary to
meet national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements; (b)
by statute, government regulation, or case law that creates conflicting
obligations or explicit authorizations, provided that, in exercising any such
authorization, an organization can demonstrate that its non-compliance with
the Principles is limited to the extent necessary to meet the overriding
legitimate interests furthered by such authorization; or (c) if the effect of the
Directive or Member State law is to allow exceptions or derogations, provided
such exceptions or derogations are applied in comparable contexts. Consistent
with the goal of enhancing privacy protection, organizations should strive to
implement these Principles fully and transparently, including indicating in
their privacy policies where exceptions to the Principles permitted by (b)
above will apply on a regular basis. For the same reason, where the option is

2

 

allowable under the Principles and/or U.S. law, organizations are expected to
opt for the higher protection where possible.
6.

Organizations are obligated to apply the Principles to all personal data
transferred in reliance on the Privacy Shield after they enter the Privacy
Shield. An organization that chooses to extend Privacy Shield benefits to
human resources personal information transferred from the EU for use in the
context of an employment relationship must indicate this when it self-certifies
to the Department and conform to the requirements set forth in the
Supplemental Principle on Self-Certification.

7.

U.S. law will apply to questions of interpretation and compliance with the
Principles and relevant privacy policies by Privacy Shield organizations,
except where such organizations have committed to cooperate with European
data protection authorities (“DPAs”). Unless otherwise stated, all provisions
of the Principles apply where they are relevant.

8.

Definitions:

9.

a.

“Personal data” and “personal information” are data about an identified
or identifiable individual that are within the scope of the Directive,
received by an organization in the United States from the European
Union, and recorded in any form.

b.

“Processing” of personal data means any operation or set of operations
which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automated
means, such as collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation
or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure or dissemination,
and erasure or destruction.

c.

“Controller” means a person or organization which, alone or jointly
with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of
personal data.

The effective date of the Principles is the date of final approval of the
European Commission’s adequacy determination.

3

 

II.

PRINCIPLES
1.

NOTICE
a.

An organization must inform individuals about:
i.

its participation in the Privacy Shield and provide a
link to, or the web address for, the Privacy Shield
List,

ii.

the types of personal data collected and, where
applicable, the entities or subsidiaries of the
organization also adhering to the Principles,

iii.

its commitment to subject to the Principles all
personal data received from the EU in reliance on the
Privacy Shield,

iv.

the purposes for which it collects and uses personal
information about them,

v.

how to contact the organization with any inquiries or
complaints, including any relevant establishment in
the EU that can respond to such inquiries or
complaints,

vi.

the type or identity of third parties to which it
discloses personal information, and the purposes for
which it does so,

vii.

the right of individuals to access their personal data,

viii.

the choices and means the organization offers
individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their
personal data,

ix.

the independent dispute resolution body designated
to address complaints and provide appropriate
recourse free of charge to the individual, and whether
it is: (1) the panel established by DPAs, (2) an
alternative dispute resolution provider based in the
EU, or (3) an alternative dispute resolution provider
based in the United States,

x.

being subject to the investigatory and enforcement
powers of the FTC, the Department of Transportation
or any other U.S. authorized statutory body,

xi.

the possibility, under certain conditions, for the
individual to invoke binding arbitration,

xii.

the requirement to disclose personal information in
response to lawful requests by public authorities,
including to meet national security or law
enforcement requirements, and

4

 

xiii.
b.

2.

3.

its liability in cases of onward transfers to third
parties.
This notice must be provided in clear and conspicuous language when
individuals are first asked to provide personal information to the
organization or as soon thereafter as is practicable, but in any event
before the organization uses such information for a purpose other than
that for which it was originally collected or processed by the
transferring organization or discloses it for the first time to a third
party.

CHOICE
a.

An organization must offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt
out) whether their personal information is (i) to be disclosed to a third
party or (ii) to be used for a purpose that is materially different from
the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently
authorized by the individuals. Individuals must be provided with clear,
conspicuous, and readily available mechanisms to exercise choice.

b.

By derogation to the previous paragraph, it is not necessary to provide
choice when disclosure is made to a third party that is acting as an
agent to perform task(s) on behalf of and under the instructions of the
organization. However, an organization shall always enter into a
contract with the agent.

c.

For sensitive information (i.e., personal information specifying medical
or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious
or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information
specifying the sex life of the individual), organizations must obtain
affirmative express consent (opt in) from individuals if such
information is to be (i) disclosed to a third party or (ii) used for a
purpose other than those for which it was originally collected or
subsequently authorized by the individuals through the exercise of optin choice. In addition, an organization should treat as sensitive any
personal information received from a third party where the third party
identifies and treats it as sensitive.

ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ONWARD TRANSFER
a.

To transfer personal information to a third party acting as a controller,
organizations must comply with the Notice and Choice Principles.
Organizations must also enter into a contract with the third-party
controller that provides that such data may only be processed for
limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent provided by
the individual and that the recipient will provide the same level of
protection as the Principles.

b.

To transfer personal data to a third party acting as an agent,
organizations must: (i) transfer such data only for limited and specified
purposes; (ii) ascertain that the agent is obligated to provide at least the

5

 

same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles; (iii)
take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent
effectively processes the personal information transferred in a manner
consistent with the organization’s obligations under the Principles; (iv)
upon notice, take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and
remediate unauthorized processing; and (v) provide a summary or a
representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its contract
with that agent to the Department upon request.
4.

SECURITY
a.

5.

Organizations creating, maintaining, using or disseminating personal
information must take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect
it from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and
destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the
processing and the nature of the personal data.

DATA INTEGRITY AND PURPOSE LIMITATION
a.

6.

Consistent with the Principles, personal information must be limited to
the information that is relevant for the purposes of processing. An
organization may not process personal information in a way that is
incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or
subsequently authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for
those purposes, an organization must take reasonable steps to ensure
that personal data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete,
and current. An organization must adhere to the Principles for as long
as it retains such information.

ACCESS
a.

7.

Individuals must have access to personal information about them that
an organization holds and be able to correct, amend, or delete that
information where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation
of the Principles, except where the burden or expense of providing
access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s
privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other
than the individual would be violated.

RECOURSE, ENFORCEMENT AND LIABILITY
a.

Effective privacy protection must include robust mechanisms for
assuring compliance with the Principles, recourse for individuals who
are affected by non-compliance with the Principles, and consequences
for the organization when the Principles are not followed. At a
minimum such mechanisms must include:
i.

readily available independent recourse mechanisms by which
each individual’s complaints and disputes are investigated and
expeditiously resolved at no cost to the individual and by

6

 

reference to the Principles, and damages awarded where the
applicable law or private-sector initiatives so provide;
ii.

follow-up procedures for verifying that the attestations and
assertions organizations make about their privacy practices are
true and that privacy practices have been implemented as
presented and, in particular, with regard to cases of noncompliance; and

iii.

obligations to remedy problems arising out of failure to comply
with the Principles by organizations announcing their
adherence to them and consequences for such organizations.
Sanctions must be sufficiently rigorous to ensure compliance
by organizations.

b.

Organizations and their selected independent recourse mechanisms
will respond promptly to inquiries and requests by the Department for
information relating to the Privacy Shield. All organizations must
respond expeditiously to complaints regarding compliance with the
Principles referred by EU Member State authorities through the
Department. Organizations that have chosen to cooperate with DPAs,
including organizations that process human resources data, must
respond directly to such authorities with regard to the investigation and
resolution of complaints.

c.

Organizations are obligated to arbitrate claims and follow the terms as
set forth in Annex I, provided that an individual has invoked binding
arbitration by delivering notice to the organization at issue and
following the procedures and subject to conditions set forth in Annex I.

d.

In the context of an onward transfer, a Privacy Shield organization has
responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives
under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party
acting as an agent on its behalf. The Privacy Shield organization shall
remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal
information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless the
organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to
the damage.

e. When an organization becomes subject to an FTC or court order based on noncompliance, the organization shall make public any relevant Privacy Shieldrelated sections of any compliance or assessment report submitted to the FTC, to
the extent consistent with confidentiality requirements. The Department has
established a dedicated point of contact for DPAs for any problems of compliance
by Privacy Shield organizations. The FTC will give priority consideration to
referrals of non-compliance with the Principles from the Department and EU
Member State authorities, and will exchange information regarding referrals with
the referring state authorities on a timely basis, subject to existing confidentiality
restrictions.

7

 

III.

SUPPLEMENTAL PRINCIPLES
1.

Sensitive Data
a.

2.

3.

An organization is not required to obtain affirmative express consent
(opt in) with respect to sensitive data where the processing is:
i.

in the vital interests of the data subject or another person;

ii.

necessary for the establishment of legal claims or defenses;

iii.

required to provide medical care or diagnosis;

iv.

carried out in the course of legitimate activities by a
foundation, association or any other non-profit body with a
political, philosophical, religious or trade-union aim and on
condition that the processing relates solely to the members of
the body or to the persons who have regular contact with it in
connection with its purposes and that the data are not disclosed
to a third party without the consent of the data subjects;

v.

necessary to carry out the organization’s obligations in the field
of employment law; or

vi.

related to data that are manifestly made public by the
individual.

Journalistic Exceptions
a.

Given U.S. constitutional protections for freedom of the press and the
Directive’s exemption for journalistic material, where the rights of a
free press embodied in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution
intersect with privacy protection interests, the First Amendment must
govern the balancing of these interests with regard to the activities of
U.S. persons or organizations.

b.

Personal information that is gathered for publication, broadcast, or
other forms of public communication of journalistic material, whether
used or not, as well as information found in previously published
material disseminated from media archives, is not subject to the
requirements of the Privacy Shield Principles.

Secondary Liability
a.

Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”), telecommunications carriers, and
other organizations are not liable under the Privacy Shield Principles
when on behalf of another organization they merely transmit, route,
switch, or cache information. As is the case with the Directive itself,
the Privacy Shield does not create secondary liability. To the extent
that an organization is acting as a mere conduit for data transmitted by
third parties and does not determine the purposes and means of
processing those personal data, it would not be liable.

8

 

4.

5.

Performing Due Diligence and Conducting Audits
a.

The activities of auditors and investment bankers may involve
processing personal data without the consent or knowledge of the
individual. This is permitted by the Notice, Choice, and Access
Principles under the circumstances described below.

b.

Public stock corporations and closely held companies, including
Privacy Shield organizations, are regularly subject to audits. Such
audits, particularly those looking into potential wrongdoing, may be
jeopardized if disclosed prematurely. Similarly, a Privacy Shield
organization involved in a potential merger or takeover will need to
perform, or be the subject of, a “due diligence” review. This will often
entail the collection and processing of personal data, such as
information on senior executives and other key personnel. Premature
disclosure could impede the transaction or even violate applicable
securities regulation. Investment bankers and attorneys engaged in due
diligence, or auditors conducting an audit, may process information
without knowledge of the individual only to the extent and for the
period necessary to meet statutory or public interest requirements and
in other circumstances in which the application of these Principles
would prejudice the legitimate interests of the organization. These
legitimate interests include the monitoring of organizations’
compliance with their legal obligations and legitimate accounting
activities, and the need for confidentiality connected with possible
acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, or other similar transactions
carried out by investment bankers or auditors.

The Role of the Data Protection Authorities
a.

Organizations will implement their commitment to cooperate with
European Union data protection authorities (“DPAs”) as described
below. Under the Privacy Shield, U.S. organizations receiving
personal data from the EU must commit to employ effective
mechanisms for assuring compliance with the Privacy Shield
Principles. More specifically as set out in the Recourse, Enforcement
and Liability Principle, participating organizations must provide:
(a)(i) recourse for individuals to whom the data relate; (a)(ii) follow up
procedures for verifying that the attestations and assertions they have
made about their privacy practices are true; and (a)(iii) obligations to
remedy problems arising out of failure to comply with the Principles
and consequences for such organizations. An organization may satisfy
points (a)(i) and (a)(iii) of the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability
Principle if it adheres to the requirements set forth here for cooperating
with the DPAs.

b.

An organization commits to cooperate with the DPAs by declaring in
its Privacy Shield self-certification submission to the Department of
Commerce (see Supplemental Principle on Self-Certification) that the
organization:

9

 

i.

elects to satisfy the requirement in points (a)(i) and (a)(iii) of
the Privacy Shield Recourse, Enforcement and Liability
Principle by committing to cooperate with the DPAs;

ii.

will cooperate with the DPAs in the investigation and
resolution of complaints brought under the Privacy Shield; and

iii.

will comply with any advice given by the DPAs where the
DPAs take the view that the organization needs to take specific
action to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles, including
remedial or compensatory measures for the benefit of
individuals affected by any non-compliance with the
Principles, and will provide the DPAs with written
confirmation that such action has been taken.

c.

Operation of DPA Panels
i.

The cooperation of the DPAs will be provided in the form of
information and advice in the following way:
1.

The advice of the DPAs will be delivered through an
informal panel of DPAs established at the European
Union level, which will inter alia help ensure a
harmonized and coherent approach.

2.

The panel will provide advice to the U.S. organizations
concerned on unresolved complaints from individuals
about the handling of personal information that has
been transferred from the EU under the Privacy Shield.
This advice will be designed to ensure that the Privacy
Shield Principles are being correctly applied and will
include any remedies for the individual(s) concerned
that the DPAs consider appropriate.

3.

The panel will provide such advice in response to
referrals from the organizations concerned and/or to
complaints received directly from individuals against
organizations which have committed to cooperate with
DPAs for Privacy Shield purposes, while encouraging
and if necessary helping such individuals in the first
instance to use the in-house complaint handling
arrangements that the organization may offer.

4.

Advice will be issued only after both sides in a dispute
have had a reasonable opportunity to comment and to
provide any evidence they wish. The panel will seek to
deliver advice as quickly as this requirement for due
process allows. As a general rule, the panel will aim to
provide advice within 60 days after receiving a
complaint or referral and more quickly where possible.

5.

The panel will make public the results of its
consideration of complaints submitted to it, if it sees fit.

10

 

6.

ii.

6.

The delivery of advice through the panel will not give
rise to any liability for the panel or for individual
DPAs.

As noted above, organizations choosing this option for dispute
resolution must undertake to comply with the advice of the
DPAs. If an organization fails to comply within 25 days of the
delivery of the advice and has offered no satisfactory
explanation for the delay, the panel will give notice of its
intention either to refer the matter to the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Transportation, or other U.S.
federal or state body with statutory powers to take enforcement
action in cases of deception or misrepresentation, or to
conclude that the agreement to cooperate has been seriously
breached and must therefore be considered null and void. In
the latter case, the panel will inform the Department of
Commerce so that the Privacy Shield List can be duly
amended. Any failure to fulfill the undertaking to cooperate
with the DPAs, as well as failures to comply with the Privacy
Shield Principles, will be actionable as a deceptive practice
under Section 5 of the FTC Act or other similar statute.

d.

An organization that wishes its Privacy Shield benefits to cover human
resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the
employment relationship must commit to cooperate with the DPAs
with regard to such data (see Supplemental Principle on Human
Resources Data).

e.

Organizations choosing this option will be required to pay an annual
fee which will be designed to cover the operating costs of the panel,
and they may additionally be asked to meet any necessary translation
expenses arising out of the panel’s consideration of referrals or
complaints against them. The annual fee will not exceed USD 500 and
will be less for smaller companies. 

Self-Certification
a.

Privacy Shield benefits are assured from the date on which the
Department has placed the organization’s self-certification submission
on the Privacy Shield List after having determined that the submission
is complete.

b.

To self-certify for the Privacy Shield, an organization must provide to
the Department a self-certification submission, signed by a corporate
officer on behalf of the organization that is joining the Privacy Shield,
that contains at least the following information:
i.

name of organization, mailing address, e-mail address,
telephone, and fax numbers;

ii.

description of the activities of the organization with respect to
personal information received from the EU; and

11

 

iii.

description of the organization’s privacy policy for such
personal information, including:
1.

if the organization has a public website, the relevant
web address where the privacy policy is available, or if
the organization does not have a public website, where
the privacy policy is available for viewing by the
public;

2.

its effective date of implementation;

3.

a contact office for the handling of complaints, access
requests, and any other issues arising under the Privacy
Shield;

4.

the specific statutory body that has jurisdiction to hear
any claims against the organization regarding possible
unfair or deceptive practices and violations of laws or
regulations governing privacy (and that is listed in the
Principles or a future annex to the Principles);

5.

name of any privacy program in which the organization
is a member;

6.

method of verification (e.g., in-house, third party) (see
Supplemental Principle on Verification; and

7.

the independent recourse mechanism that is available to
investigate unresolved complaints.

c.

Where the organization wishes its Privacy Shield benefits to cover
human resources information transferred from the EU for use in the
context of the employment relationship, it may do so where a statutory
body listed in the Principles or a future annex to the Principles has
jurisdiction to hear claims against the organization arising out of the
processing of human resources information.
In addition, the
organization must indicate this in its self-certification submission and
declare its commitment to cooperate with the EU authority or
authorities concerned in conformity with the Supplemental Principles
on Human Resources Data and the Role of the Data Protection
Authorities as applicable and that it will comply with the advice given
by such authorities.
The organization must also provide the
Department with a copy of its human resources privacy policy and
provide information where the privacy policy is available for viewing
by its affected employees.

d.

The Department will maintain the Privacy Shield List of organizations
that file completed self-certification submissions, thereby assuring the
availability of Privacy Shield benefits, and will update such list on the
basis of annual self-recertification submissions and notifications
received pursuant to the Supplemental Principle on Dispute Resolution
and Enforcement.
Such self-certification submissions must be
provided not less than annually; otherwise the organization will be
removed from the Privacy Shield List and Privacy Shield benefits will

12

 

no longer be assured. Both the Privacy Shield List and the selfcertification submissions by the organizations will be made publicly
available. All organizations that are placed on the Privacy Shield List
by the Department must also state in their relevant published privacy
policy statements that they adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. If
available online, an organization’s privacy policy must include a
hyperlink to the Department’s Privacy Shield website and a hyperlink
to the website or complaint submission form of the independent
recourse mechanism that is available to investigate unresolved
complaints.
e.

The Privacy Principles apply immediately upon certification.
Recognizing that the Principles will impact commercial relationships
with third parties, organizations that certify to the Privacy Shield
Framework in the first two months following the Framework’s
effective date shall bring existing commercial relationships with third
parties into conformity with the Accountability for Onward Transfer
Principle as soon as possible, and in any event no later than nine
months from the date upon which they certify to the Privacy Shield.
During that interim period, where organizations transfer data to a third
party, they shall (i) apply the Notice and Choice Principles, and (ii)
where personal data is transferred to a third party acting as an agent,
ascertain that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level
of protection as is required by the Principles.

f.

An organization must subject to the Privacy Shield Principles all
personal data received from the EU in reliance upon the Privacy
Shield. The undertaking to adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles is
not time-limited in respect of personal data received during the period
in which the organization enjoys the benefits of the Privacy Shield. Its
undertaking means that it will continue to apply the Principles to such
data for as long as the organization stores, uses or discloses them, even
if it subsequently leaves the Privacy Shield for any reason. An
organization that withdraws from the Privacy Shield but wants to
retain such data must affirm to the Department on an annual basis its
commitment to continue to apply the Principles or provide “adequate”
protection for the information by another authorized means (for
example, using a contract that fully reflects the requirements of the
relevant standard contractual clauses adopted by the European
Commission); otherwise, the organization must return or delete the
information. An organization that withdraws from the Privacy Shield
must remove from any relevant privacy policy any references to the
Privacy Shield that imply that the organization continues to actively
participate in the Privacy Shield and is entitled to its benefits.

g.

An organization that will cease to exist as a separate legal entity as a
result of a merger or a takeover must notify the Department of this in
advance. The notification should also indicate whether the acquiring
entity or the entity resulting from the merger will (i) continue to be
bound by the Privacy Shield Principles by the operation of law
governing the takeover or merger or (ii) elect to self-certify its

13

 

adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles or put in place other
safeguards, such as a written agreement that will ensure adherence to
the Privacy Shield Principles. Where neither (i) nor (ii) applies, any
personal data that has been acquired under the Privacy Shield must be
promptly deleted.
h.

7.

When an organization leaves the Privacy Shield for any reason, it must
remove all statements implying that the organization continues to
participate in the Privacy Shield or is entitled to the benefits of the
Privacy Shield. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certification mark, if
used, must also be removed. Any misrepresentation to the general
public concerning an organization’s adherence to the Privacy Shield
Principles may be actionable by the FTC or other relevant government
body. Misrepresentations to the Department may be actionable under
the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. § 1001).

Verification
a.

Organizations must provide follow up procedures for verifying that the
attestations and assertions they make about their Privacy Shield
privacy practices are true and those privacy practices have been
implemented as represented and in accordance with the Privacy Shield
Principles.

b.

To meet the verification requirements of the Recourse, Enforcement
and Liability Principle, an organization must verify such attestations
and assertions either through self-assessment or outside compliance
reviews.

c.

Under the self-assessment approach, such verification must indicate
that an organization’s published privacy policy regarding personal
information received from the EU is accurate, comprehensive,
prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible. It
must also indicate that its privacy policy conforms to the Privacy
Shield Principles; that individuals are informed of any in-house
arrangements for handling complaints and of the independent
mechanisms through which they may pursue complaints; that it has in
place procedures for training employees in its implementation, and
disciplining them for failure to follow it; and that it has in place
internal procedures for periodically conducting objective reviews of
compliance with the above. A statement verifying the self-assessment
must be signed by a corporate officer or other authorized
representative of the organization at least once a year and made
available upon request by individuals or in the context of an
investigation or a complaint about non-compliance.

d.

Where the organization has chosen outside compliance review, such a
review must demonstrate that its privacy policy regarding personal
information received from the EU conforms to the Privacy Shield
Principles, that it is being complied with, and that individuals are
informed of the mechanisms through which they may pursue
complaints. The methods of review may include, without limitation,

14

 

auditing, random reviews, use of “decoys”, or use of technology tools
as appropriate. A statement verifying that an outside compliance
review has been successfully completed must be signed either by the
reviewer or by the corporate officer or other authorized representative
of the organization at least once a year and made available upon
request by individuals or in the context of an investigation or a
complaint about compliance.
e.

8.

Organizations must retain their records on the implementation of their
Privacy Shield privacy practices and make them available upon
request in the context of an investigation or a complaint about noncompliance to the independent body responsible for investigating
complaints or to the agency with unfair and deceptive practices
jurisdiction. Organizations must also respond promptly to inquiries
and other requests for information from the Department relating to the
organization’s adherence to the Principles.

Access
a.

The Access Principle in Practice
i.

ii.

Under the Privacy Shield Principles, the right of access is
fundamental to privacy protection. In particular, it allows
individuals to verify the accuracy of information held about
them. The Access Principle means that individuals have the
right to:
1.

obtain from an organization confirmation of whether or
not the organization is processing personal data relating
to them;1

2.

have communicated to them such data so that they
could verify its accuracy and the lawfulness of the
processing; and

3.

have the data corrected, amended or deleted where it is
inaccurate or processed in violation of the Principles.

Individuals do not have to justify requests for access to their
personal data. In responding to individuals’ access requests,
organizations should first be guided by the concern(s) that led
to the requests in the first place. For example, if an access
request is vague or broad in scope, an organization may engage
the individual in a dialogue so as to better understand the
motivation for the request and to locate responsive information.
The organization might inquire about which part(s) of the
organization the individual interacted with or about the nature

                                                            
1

The organization should answer requests from an individual concerning the purposes of the
processing, the categories of personal data concerned, and the recipients or categories of
recipients to whom the personal data is disclosed.

15

 

of the information or its use that is the subject of the access
request.
iii.

b.

Consistent with the fundamental nature of access, organizations
should always make good faith efforts to provide access. For
example, where certain information needs to be protected and
can be readily separated from other personal information
subject to an access request, the organization should redact the
protected information and make available the other
information. If an organization determines that access should
be restricted in any particular instance, it should provide the
individual requesting access with an explanation of why it has
made that determination and a contact point for any further
inquiries.
Burden or Expense of Providing Access

i.

The right of access to personal data may be restricted in
exceptional circumstances where the legitimate rights of
persons other than the individual would be violated or where
the burden or expense of providing access would be
disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the
case in question. Expense and burden are important factors
and should be taken into account but they are not controlling
factors in determining whether providing access is reasonable.

ii.

For example, if the personal information is used for decisions
that will significantly affect the individual (e.g., the denial or
grant of important benefits, such as insurance, a mortgage, or a
job), then consistent with the other provisions of these
Supplemental Principles, the organization would have to
disclose that information even if it is relatively difficult or
expensive to provide. If the personal information requested is
not sensitive or not used for decisions that will significantly
affect the individual, but is readily available and inexpensive to
provide, an organization would have to provide access to such
information.

c.

Confidential Commercial Information
i.

Confidential commercial information is information that an
organization has taken steps to protect from disclosure, where
disclosure would help a competitor in the market.
Organizations may deny or limit access to the extent that
granting full access would reveal its own confidential
commercial information, such as marketing inferences or
classifications generated by the organization, or the
confidential commercial information of another that is subject
to a contractual obligation of confidentiality.

ii.

Where confidential commercial information can be readily
separated from other personal information subject to an access

16

 

request, the organization should redact the confidential
commercial information and make available the nonconfidential information.
d.

Organization of Data Bases
i.

Access can be provided in the form of disclosure of the
relevant personal information by an organization to the
individual and does not require access by the individual to an
organization’s data base.

ii.

Access needs to be provided only to the extent that an
organization stores the personal information. The Access
Principle does not itself create any obligation to retain,
maintain, reorganize, or restructure personal information files.

e.

When Access May be Restricted
i.

As organizations must always make good faith efforts to
provide individuals with access to their personal data, the
circumstances in which organizations may restrict such access
are limited, and any reasons for restricting access must be
specific. As under the Directive, an organization can restrict
access to information to the extent that disclosure is likely to
interfere with the safeguarding of important countervailing
public interests, such as national security; defense; or public
security. In addition, where personal information is processed
solely for research or statistical purposes, access may be
denied. Other reasons for denying or limiting access are:

ii.

1.

interference with the execution or enforcement of the
law or with private causes of action, including the
prevention, investigation or detection of offenses or the
right to a fair trial;

2.

disclosure where the legitimate rights or important
interests of others would be violated;

3.

breaching a legal or other professional privilege or
obligation;

4.

prejudicing employee security investigations or
grievance proceedings or in connection with employee
succession planning and corporate re-organizations; or

5.

prejudicing the confidentiality necessary in monitoring,
inspection or regulatory functions connected with sound
management, or in future or ongoing negotiations
involving the organization.

An organization which claims an exception has the burden of
demonstrating its necessity, and the reasons for restricting
access and a contact point for further inquiries should be given
to individuals.

17

 

f.

Right to Obtain Confirmation and Charging a Fee to Cover the Costs
for Providing Access
i.

An individual has the right to obtain confirmation of whether
or not this organization has personal data relating to him or her.
An individual also has the right to have communicated to him
or her personal data relating to him or her. An organization
may charge a fee that is not excessive.

ii.

Charging a fee may be justified, for example, where requests
for access are manifestly excessive, in particular because of
their repetitive character.

iii.

Access may not be refused on cost grounds if the individual
offers to pay the costs.

g.

Repetitious or Vexatious Requests for Access
i.

h.

Fraudulent Requests for Access
i.

i.

An organization is not required to provide access unless it is
supplied with sufficient information to allow it to confirm the
identity of the person making the request.
Timeframe for Responses

i.

9.

An organization may set reasonable limits on the number of
times within a given period that access requests from a
particular individual will be met. In setting such limitations, an
organization should consider such factors as the frequency with
which information is updated, the purpose for which the data
are used, and the nature of the information.

Organizations should respond to access requests within a
reasonable time period, in a reasonable manner, and in a form
that is readily intelligible to the individual. An organization
that provides information to data subjects at regular intervals
may satisfy an individual access request with its regular
disclosure if it would not constitute an excessive delay.

Human Resources Data
a.

Coverage by the Privacy Shield
i.

Where an organization in the EU transfers personal information
about its employees (past or present) collected in the context of
the employment relationship, to a parent, affiliate, or
unaffiliated service provider in the United States participating
in the Privacy Shield, the transfer enjoys the benefits of the
Privacy Shield. In such cases, the collection of the information
and its processing prior to transfer will have been subject to the
national laws of the EU country where it was collected, and
any conditions for or restrictions on its transfer according to
those laws will have to be respected.

18

 

ii.

b.

Application of the Notice and Choice Principles
i.

A U.S. organization that has received employee information
from the EU under the Privacy Shield may disclose it to third
parties or use it for different purposes only in accordance with
the Notice and Choice Principles. For example, where an
organization intends to use personal information collected
through the employment relationship for non-employmentrelated purposes, such as marketing communications, the U.S.
organization must provide the affected individuals with the
requisite choice before doing so, unless they have already
authorized the use of the information for such purposes.
Moreover, such choices must not be used to restrict
employment opportunities or take any punitive action against
such employees.

ii.

It should be noted that certain generally applicable conditions
for transfer from some EU Member States may preclude other
uses of such information even after transfer outside the EU and
such conditions will have to be respected.

iii.

In addition, employers should make reasonable efforts to
accommodate employee privacy preferences. This could
include, for example, restricting access to the personal data,
anonymizing certain data, or assigning codes or pseudonyms
when the actual names are not required for the management
purpose at hand.

iv.

To the extent and for the period necessary to avoid prejudicing
the ability of the organization in making promotions,
appointments, or other similar employment decisions, an
organization does not need to offer notice and choice.

c.

Application of the Access Principle
i.

d.

The Privacy Shield Principles are relevant only when
individually identified records are transferred or accessed.
Statistical reporting relying on aggregate employment data and
containing no personal data or the use of anonymized data does
not raise privacy concerns.

The Supplemental Principle on Access provides guidance on
reasons which may justify denying or limiting access on
request in the human resources context. Of course, employers
in the European Union must comply with local regulations and
ensure that European Union employees have access to such
information as is required by law in their home countries,
regardless of the location of data processing and storage. The
Privacy Shield requires that an organization processing such
data in the United States will cooperate in providing such
access either directly or through the EU employer.
Enforcement

19

 

i.

In so far as personal information is used only in the context of
the employment relationship, primary responsibility for the
data vis-à-vis the employee remains with the organization in
the EU. It follows that, where European employees make
complaints about violations of their data protection rights and
are not satisfied with the results of internal review, complaint,
and appeal procedures (or any applicable grievance procedures
under a contract with a trade union), they should be directed to
the state or national data protection or labor authority in the
jurisdiction where the employees work. This includes cases
where the alleged mishandling of their personal information is
the responsibility of the U.S. organization that has received the
information from the employer and thus involves an alleged
breach of the Privacy Shield Principles. This will be the most
efficient way to address the often overlapping rights and
obligations imposed by local labor law and labor agreements as
well as data protection law.

ii.

A U.S. organization participating in the Privacy Shield that
uses EU human resources data transferred from the European
Union in the context of the employment relationship and that
wishes such transfers to be covered by the Privacy Shield must
therefore commit to cooperate in investigations by and to
comply with the advice of competent EU authorities in such
cases.

e.

Application of the Accountability for Onward Transfer Principle
i.

10.

For occasional employment-related operational needs of the
Privacy Shield organization with respect to personal data
transferred under the Privacy Shield, such as the booking of a
flight, hotel room, or insurance coverage, transfers of personal
data of a small number of employees can take place to
controllers without application of the Access Principle or
entering into a contract with the third-party controller, as
otherwise required under the Accountability for Onward
Transfer Principle, provided that the Privacy Shield
organization has complied with the Notice and Choice
Principles.

Obligatory Contracts for Onward Transfers
a.

Data Processing Contracts
i.

When personal data is transferred from the EU to the United
States only for processing purposes, a contract will be required,
regardless of participation by the processor in the Privacy
Shield.

ii.

Data controllers in the European Union are always required to
enter into a contract when a transfer for mere processing is
made, whether the processing operation is carried out inside or
outside the EU, and whether or not the processor participates in
20

 

the Privacy Shield. The purpose of the contract is to make sure
that the processor:

iii.

b.

acts only on instructions from the controller;

2.

provides appropriate technical and organizational
measures to protect personal data against accidental or
unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alternation,
unauthorized disclosure or access, and understands
whether onward transfer is allowed; and

3.

taking into account the nature of the processing, assists
the controller in responding to individuals exercising
their rights under the Principles.

Because adequate protection is provided by Privacy Shield
participants, contracts with Privacy Shield participants for mere
processing do not require prior authorization (or such
authorization will be granted automatically by the EU Member
States), as would be required for contracts with recipients not
participating in the Privacy Shield or otherwise not providing
adequate protection.
Transfers within a Controlled Group of Corporations or Entities

i.

When personal information is transferred between two
controllers within a controlled group of corporations or entities,
a contract is not always required under the Accountability for
Onward Transfer Principle.
Data controllers within a
controlled group of corporations or entities may base such
transfers on other instruments, such as EU Binding Corporate
Rules or other intra-group instruments (e.g., compliance and
control programs), ensuring the continuity of protection of
personal information under the Privacy Shield Principles. In
case of such transfers, the Privacy Shield organization remains
responsible for compliance with Privacy Shield Principles.
Transfers between Controllers 

c.
i.

11.

1.

For transfers between controllers, the recipient controller need
not be a Privacy Shield organization or have an independent
recourse mechanism. The Privacy Shield organization must
enter into a contract with the recipient third-party controller
that provides for the same level of protection as is available
under the Privacy Shield, not including the requirement that the
third party controller be a Privacy Shield organization or have
an independent recourse mechanism, provided it makes
available an equivalent mechanism.

Dispute Resolution and Enforcement
a.

The Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle sets out the
requirements for Privacy Shield enforcement. How to meet the
requirements of point (a)(ii) of the Principle is set out in the
21

 

Supplemental Principle on Verification. This Supplemental Principle
addresses points (a)(i) and (a)(iii), both of which require independent
recourse mechanisms. These mechanisms may take different forms,
but they must meet the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability
Principle’s requirements. Organizations satisfy the requirements
through the following: (i) compliance with private sector developed
privacy programs that incorporate the Privacy Shield Principles into
their rules and that include effective enforcement mechanisms of the
type described in the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle;
(ii) compliance with legal or regulatory supervisory authorities that
provide for handling of individual complaints and dispute resolution;
or (iii) commitment to cooperate with data protection authorities
located in the European Union or their authorized representatives.
b.

This list is intended to be illustrative and not limiting. The private
sector may design additional mechanisms to provide enforcement, so
long as they meet the requirements of the Recourse, Enforcement and
Liability Principle and the Supplemental Principles. Please note that
the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle’s requirements are
additional to the requirement that self-regulatory efforts must be
enforceable under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,
which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts, or another law or regulation
prohibiting such acts.

c.

In order to help ensure compliance with their Privacy Shield
commitments and to support the administration of the program,
organizations, as well as their independent recourse mechanisms, must
provide information relating to the Privacy Shield when requested by
the Department. In addition, organizations must respond expeditiously
to complaints regarding their compliance with the Principles referred
through the Department by DPAs. The response should address
whether the complaint has merit and, if so, how the organization will
rectify the problem. The Department will protect the confidentiality of
information it receives in accordance with U.S. law.

d.

Recourse Mechanisms
i.

Consumers should be encouraged to raise any complaints they
may have with the relevant organization before proceeding to
independent recourse mechanisms.
Organizations must
respond to a consumer within 45 days of receiving a complaint.
Whether a recourse mechanism is independent is a factual
question that can be demonstrated notably by impartiality,
transparent composition and financing, and a proven track
record. As required by the Recourse, Enforcement and
Liability Principle, the recourse available to individuals must
be readily available and free of charge to individuals. Dispute
resolution bodies should look into each complaint received
from individuals unless they are obviously unfounded or
frivolous. This does not preclude the establishment of
eligibility requirements by the organization operating the
recourse mechanism, but such requirements should be

22

 

transparent and justified (for example, to exclude complaints
that fall outside the scope of the program or are for
consideration in another forum), and should not have the effect
of undermining the commitment to look into legitimate
complaints. In addition, recourse mechanisms should provide
individuals with full and readily available information about
how the dispute resolution procedure works when they file a
complaint. Such information should include notice about the
mechanism’s privacy practices, in conformity with the Privacy
Shield Principles.
They should also cooperate in the
development of tools such as standard complaint forms to
facilitate the complaint resolution process.
ii.

Independent recourse mechanisms must include on their public
websites information regarding the Privacy Shield Principles
and the services that they provide under the Privacy Shield.
This information must include: (1) information on or a link to
the Privacy Shield Principles’ requirements for independent
recourse mechanisms; (2) a link to the Department’s Privacy
Shield website; (3) an explanation that their dispute resolution
services under the Privacy Shield are free of charge to
individuals; (4) a description of how a Privacy Shield-related
complaint can be filed; (5) the timeframe in which Privacy
Shield-related complaints are processed; and (6) a description
of the range of potential remedies.

iii.

Independent recourse mechanisms must publish an annual
report providing aggregate statistics regarding their dispute
resolution services. The annual report must include: (1) the
total number of Privacy Shield-related complaints received
during the reporting year; (2) the types of complaints received;
(3) dispute resolution quality measures, such as the length of
time taken to process complaints; and (4) the outcomes of the
complaints received, notably the number and types of remedies
or sanctions imposed.

iv.

As set forth in Annex I, an arbitration option is available to an
individual to determine, for residual claims, whether a Privacy
Shield organization has violated its obligations under the
Principles as to that individual, and whether any such violation
remains fully or partially unremedied. This option is available
only for these purposes. This option is not available, for
example, with respect to the exceptions to the Principles2 or
with respect to an allegation about the adequacy of the Privacy
Shield. Under this arbitration option, the Privacy Shield Panel
(consisting of one or three arbitrators, as agreed by the parties)
has the authority to impose individual-specific, non-monetary
equitable relief (such as access, correction, deletion, or return

                                                            
2

Section I.5 of the Principles.

23

 

of the individual’s data in question) necessary to remedy the
violation of the Principles only with respect to the individual.
Individuals and Privacy Shield organizations will be able to
seek judicial review and enforcement of the arbitral decisions
pursuant to U.S. law under the Federal Arbitration Act.
e.

Remedies and Sanctions
i.

f.

The result of any remedies provided by the dispute resolution
body should be that the effects of non-compliance are reversed
or corrected by the organization, insofar as feasible, and that
future processing by the organization will be in conformity
with the Principles and, where appropriate, that processing of
the personal data of the individual who brought the complaint
will cease. Sanctions need to be rigorous enough to ensure
compliance by the organization with the Principles. A range of
sanctions of varying degrees of severity will allow dispute
resolution bodies to respond appropriately to varying degrees
of non-compliance. Sanctions should include both publicity
for findings of non-compliance and the requirement to delete
data in certain circumstances.3 Other sanctions could include
suspension and removal of a seal, compensation for individuals
for losses incurred as a result of non-compliance and injunctive
awards. Private sector dispute resolution bodies and selfregulatory bodies must notify failures of Privacy Shield
organizations to comply with their rulings to the governmental
body with applicable jurisdiction or to the courts, as
appropriate, and to notify the Department.
FTC Action

ii.

The FTC has committed to reviewing on a priority basis
referrals alleging non-compliance with the Principles received
from: (i) privacy self-regulatory organizations and other
independent dispute resolution bodies; (ii) EU Member States;
and (iii) the Department, to determine whether Section 5 of the
FTC Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices in
commerce has been violated. If the FTC concludes that it has
reason to believe Section 5 has been violated, it may resolve
the matter by seeking an administrative cease and desist order
prohibiting the challenged practices or by filing a complaint in
a federal district court, which if successful could result in a
federal court order to same effect. This includes false claims of
adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles or participation in
the Privacy Shield by organizations, which either are no longer

                                                            
3

Dispute resolution bodies have discretion about the circumstances in which they use these
sanctions. The sensitivity of the data concerned is one factor to be taken into consideration in
deciding whether deletion of data should be required, as is whether an organization has
collected, used, or disclosed information in blatant contravention of the Privacy Shield
Principles.

on the Privacy Shield List or have never self-certified to the
Department. The FTC may obtain civil penalties for violations
of an administrative cease and desist order and may pursue
civil or criminal contempt for violation of a federal court order.
The FTC will notify the Department of any such actions it
takes. The Department encourages other government bodies to
notify it of the final disposition of any such referrals or other
rulings determining adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles.
g.

Persistent Failure to Comply
i.

If an organization persistently fails to comply with the
Principles, it is no longer entitled to benefit from the Privacy
Shield. Organizations that have persistently failed to comply
with the Principles will be removed from the Privacy Shield
List by the Department and must return or delete the personal
information they received under the Privacy Shield.

ii.

Persistent failure to comply arises where an organization that
has self-certified to the Department refuses to comply with a
final determination by any privacy self-regulatory, independent
dispute resolution, or government body, or where such a body
determines that an organization frequently fails to comply with
the Principles to the point where its claim to comply is no
longer credible. In these cases, the organization must promptly
notify the Department of such facts. Failure to do so may be
actionable under the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. § 1001).
An organization’s withdrawal from a private-sector privacy
self-regulatory program or independent dispute resolution
mechanism does not relieve it of its obligation to comply with
the Principles and would constitute a persistent failure to
comply.

iii.

The Department will remove an organization from the Privacy
Shield List in response to any notification it receives of
persistent failure to comply, whether it is received from the
organization itself, from a privacy self-regulatory body or
another independent dispute resolution body, or from a
government body, but only after first providing 30 days’ notice
and an opportunity to respond to the organization that has
failed to comply. Accordingly, the Privacy Shield List
maintained by the Department will make clear which
organizations are assured and which organizations are no
longer assured of Privacy Shield benefits.

iv.

An organization applying to participate in a self-regulatory
body for the purposes of requalifying for the Privacy Shield
must provide that body with full information about its prior
participation in the Privacy Shield.

Choice – Timing of Opt Out
a.

Generally, the purpose of the Choice Principle is to ensure that
personal information is used and disclosed in ways that are consistent
with the individual’s expectations and choices. Accordingly, an
individual should be able to exercise “opt out” choice of having
personal information used for direct marketing at any time subject to
reasonable limits established by the organization, such as giving the
organization time to make the opt out effective. An organization may
also require sufficient information to confirm the identity of the
individual requesting the “opt out.” In the United States, individuals
may be able to exercise this option through the use of a central “opt
out” program such as the Direct Marketing Association’s Mail
Preference Service. Organizations that participate in the Direct
Marketing Association’s Mail Preference Service should promote its
availability to consumers who do not wish to receive commercial
information. In any event, an individual should be given a readily
available and affordable mechanism to exercise this option.

b.

Similarly, an organization may use information for certain direct
marketing purposes when it is impracticable to provide the individual
with an opportunity to opt out before using the information, if the
organization promptly gives the individual such opportunity at the
same time (and upon request at any time) to decline (at no cost to the
individual) to receive any further direct marketing communications
and the organization complies with the individual’s wishes.

Travel Information
a.

Airline passenger reservation and other travel information, such as
frequent flyer or hotel reservation information and special handling
needs, such as meals to meet religious requirements or physical
assistance, may be transferred to organizations located outside the EU
in several different circumstances. Under Article 26 of the Directive,
personal data may be transferred “to a third country which does not
ensure an adequate level of protection within the meaning of Article
25(2)” on the condition that it (i) is necessary to provide the services
requested by the consumer or to fulfill the terms of an agreement, such
as a “frequent flyer” agreement; or (ii) has been unambiguously
consented to by the consumer. U.S. organizations subscribing to the
Privacy Shield provide adequate protection for personal data and may
therefore receive data transfers from the EU without meeting these
conditions or other conditions set out in Article 26 of the Directive.
Since the Privacy Shield includes specific rules for sensitive
information, such information (which may need to be collected, for
example, in connection with customers’ needs for physical assistance)
may be included in transfers to Privacy Shield participants. In all
cases, however, the organization transferring the information has to
respect the law in the EU Member State in which it is operating, which
may inter alia impose special conditions for the handling of sensitive
data.

26

 

14.

Pharmaceutical and Medical Products

a.

Application of EU Member State Laws or the Privacy Shield
Principles
i.

b.

EU Member State law applies to the collection of the personal
data and to any processing that takes place prior to the transfer
to the United States. The Privacy Shield Principles apply to the
data once they have been transferred to the United States. Data
used for pharmaceutical research and other purposes should be
anonymized when appropriate.
Future Scientific Research

i.

Personal data developed in specific medical or pharmaceutical
research studies often play a valuable role in future scientific
research. Where personal data collected for one research study
are transferred to a U.S. organization in the Privacy Shield, the
organization may use the data for a new scientific research
activity if appropriate notice and choice have been provided in
the first instance. Such notice should provide information
about any future specific uses of the data, such as periodic
follow-up, related studies, or marketing.

ii.

It is understood that not all future uses of the data can be
specified, since a new research use could arise from new
insights on the original data, new medical discoveries and
advances, and public health and regulatory developments.
Where appropriate, the notice should therefore include an
explanation that personal data may be used in future medical
and pharmaceutical research activities that are unanticipated.
If the use is not consistent with the general research purpose(s)
for which the personal data were originally collected, or to
which the individual has consented subsequently, new consent
must be obtained.

c.

Withdrawal from a Clinical Trial
i.

d.

Participants may decide or be asked to withdraw from a clinical
trial at any time. Any personal data collected previous to
withdrawal may still be processed along with other data
collected as part of the clinical trial, however, if this was made
clear to the participant in the notice at the time he or she agreed
to participate.
Transfers for Regulatory and Supervision Purposes

i.

Pharmaceutical and medical device companies are allowed to
provide personal data from clinical trials conducted in the EU
to regulators in the United States for regulatory and supervision
purposes. Similar transfers are allowed to parties other than
regulators, such as company locations and other researchers,
consistent with the Principles of Notice and Choice.

27

 

e.

“Blinded” Studies
i.

To ensure objectivity in many clinical trials, participants, and
often investigators as well, cannot be given access to
information about which treatment each participant may be
receiving. Doing so would jeopardize the validity of the
research study and results. Participants in such clinical trials
(referred to as “blinded” studies) do not have to be provided
access to the data on their treatment during the trial if this
restriction has been explained when the participant entered the
trial and the disclosure of such information would jeopardize
the integrity of the research effort.

ii.

Agreement to participate in the trial under these conditions is a
reasonable forgoing of the right of access. Following the
conclusion of the trial and analysis of the results, participants
should have access to their data if they request it. They should
seek it primarily from the physician or other health care
provider from whom they received treatment within the clinical
trial, or secondarily from the sponsoring organization.

f.

Product Safety and Efficacy Monitoring
i.

g.

A pharmaceutical or medical device company does not have to
apply the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the Notice,
Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, and Access
Principles in its product safety and efficacy monitoring
activities, including the reporting of adverse events and the
tracking of patients/subjects using certain medicines or medical
devices, to the extent that adherence to the Principles interferes
with compliance with regulatory requirements. This is true
both with respect to reports by, for example, health care
providers to pharmaceutical and medical device companies,
and with respect to reports by pharmaceutical and medical
device companies to government agencies like the Food and
Drug Administration.
Key-coded Data

i.

Invariably, research data are uniquely key-coded at their origin
by the principal investigator so as not to reveal the identity of
individual data subjects. Pharmaceutical companies sponsoring
such research do not receive the key. The unique key code is
held only by the researcher, so that he or she can identify the
research subject under special circumstances (e.g., if follow-up
medical attention is required). A transfer from the EU to the
United States of data coded in this way would not constitute a
transfer of personal data that would be subject to the Privacy
Shield Principles.

28

 

15.

16.

Public Record and Publicly Available Information
a.

An organization must apply the Privacy Shield Principles of Security,
Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, and Recourse, Enforcement and
Liability to personal data from publicly available sources. These
Principles shall apply also to personal data collected from public
records, i.e., those records kept by government agencies or entities at
any level that are open to consultation by the public in general.

b.

It is not necessary to apply the Notice, Choice, or Accountability for
Onward Transfer Principles to public record information, as long as it
is not combined with non-public record information, and any
conditions for consultation established by the relevant jurisdiction are
respected. Also, it is generally not necessary to apply the Notice,
Choice, or Accountability for Onward Transfer Principles to publicly
available information unless the European transferor indicates that
such information is subject to restrictions that require application of
those Principles by the organization for the uses it intends.
Organizations will have no liability for how such information is used
by those obtaining such information from published materials.

c.

Where an organization is found to have intentionally made personal
information public in contravention of the Principles so that it or
others may benefit from these exceptions, it will cease to qualify for
the benefits of the Privacy Shield.

d.

It is not necessary to apply the Access Principle to public record
information as long as it is not combined with other personal
information (apart from small amounts used to index or organize the
public record information); however, any conditions for consultation
established by the relevant jurisdiction are to be respected. In contrast,
where public record information is combined with other non-public
record information (other than as specifically noted above), an
organization must provide access to all such information, assuming it
is not subject to other permitted exceptions.

e.

As with public record information, it is not necessary to provide access
to information that is already publicly available to the public at large,
as long as it is not combined with non-publicly available information.
Organizations that are in the business of selling publicly available
information may charge the organization’s customary fee in
responding to requests for access. Alternatively, individuals may seek
access to their information from the organization that originally
compiled the data.

Access Requests by Public Authorities
a.

In order to provide transparency in respect of lawful requests by public
authorities to access personal information, Privacy Shield
organizations may voluntarily issue periodic transparency reports on
the number of requests for personal information they receive by public

29

 

authorities for law enforcement or national security reasons, to the
extent such disclosures are permissible under applicable law.
b.

The information provided by the Privacy Shield organizations in these
reports together with information that has been released by the
intelligence community, along with other information, can be used to
inform the annual joint review of the functioning of the Privacy Shield
in accordance with the Principles.

c.

Absence of notice in accordance with point (a)(xii) of the Notice
Principle shall not prevent or impair an organization’s ability to
respond to any lawful request.

ANNEX I:
Arbitral Model

ANNEX I
This Annex I provides the terms under which Privacy Shield organizations are obligated to
arbitrate claims, pursuant to the Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle. The binding
arbitration option described below applies to certain “residual” claims as to data covered by the
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. The purpose of this option is to provide a prompt, independent, and fair
mechanism, at the option of individuals, for resolution of claimed violations of the Principles not
resolved by any of the other Privacy Shield mechanisms, if any.
A.

Scope

This arbitration option is available to an individual to determine, for residual claims, whether a
Privacy Shield organization has violated its obligations under the Principles as to that individual,
and whether any such violation remains fully or partially unremedied. This option is available
only for these purposes. This option is not available, for example, with respect to the exceptions
to the Principles1 or with respect to an allegation about the adequacy of the Privacy Shield.
B.

Available Remedies

Under this arbitration option, the Privacy Shield Panel (consisting of one or three arbitrators, as
agreed by the parties) has the authority to impose individual-specific, non-monetary equitable
relief (such as access, correction, deletion, or return of the individual’s data in question)
necessary to remedy the violation of the Principles only with respect to the individual. These are
the only powers of the arbitration panel with respect to remedies. In considering remedies, the
arbitration panel is required to consider other remedies that already have been imposed by other
mechanisms under the Privacy Shield. No damages, costs, fees, or other remedies are available.
Each party bears its own attorney’s fees.
C.

Pre-Arbitration Requirements

An individual who decides to invoke this arbitration option must take the following steps prior to
initiating an arbitration claim: (1) raise the claimed violation directly with the organization and
afford the organization an opportunity to resolve the issue within the timeframe set forth in
Section III.11(d)(i) of the Principles; (2) make use of the independent recourse mechanism under
the Principles, which is at no cost to the individual; and (3) raise the issue through their Data
Protection Authority to the Department of Commerce and afford the Department of Commerce
an opportunity to use best efforts to resolve the issue within the timeframes set forth in the Letter
from the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce, at no cost to the
individual.
This arbitration option may not be invoked if the individual’s same claimed violation of the
Principles (1) has previously been subject to binding arbitration; (2) was the subject of a final
judgment entered in a court action to which the individual was a party; or (3) was previously
settled by the parties. In addition, this option may not be invoked if an EU Data Protection
                                                       
1

Section I.5 of the Principles.

Authority (1) has authority under Sections III.5 or III.9 of the Principles; or (2) has the authority
to resolve the claimed violation directly with the organization. A DPA’s authority to resolve the
same claim against an EU data controller does not alone preclude invocation of this arbitration
option against a different legal entity not bound by the DPA authority.
D.

Binding Nature of Decisions

An individual’s decision to invoke this binding arbitration option is entirely voluntary. Arbitral
decisions will be binding on all parties to the arbitration. Once invoked, the individual forgoes
the option to seek relief for the same claimed violation in another forum, except that if nonmonetary equitable relief does not fully remedy the claimed violation, the individual’s invocation
of arbitration will not preclude a claim for damages that is otherwise available in the courts.
E.

Review and Enforcement

Individuals and Privacy Shield organizations will be able to seek judicial review and
enforcement of the arbitral decisions pursuant to U.S. law under the Federal Arbitration Act.2
Any such cases must be brought in the federal district court whose territorial coverage includes
the primary place of business of the Privacy Shield organization.

                                                       
2

Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) provides that “[a]n arbitration agreement or arbitral
award arising out of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, which is considered as commercial,
including a transaction, contract, or agreement described in [section 2 of the FAA], falls under the
Convention [on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of June 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T.
2519, T.I.A.S. No. 6997 (“New York Convention”)].” 9 U.S.C. § 202. The FAA further provides that
“[a]n agreement or award arising out of such a relationship which is entirely between citizens of the
United States shall be deemed not to fall under the [New York] Convention unless that relationship
involves property located abroad, envisages performance or enforcement abroad, or has some other
reasonable relation with one or more foreign states.” Id. Under Chapter 2, “any party to the arbitration
may apply to any court having jurisdiction under this chapter for an order confirming the award as against
any other party to the arbitration. The court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for
refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said [New York]
Convention.” Id. § 207. Chapter 2 further provides that “[t]he district courts of the United States . . .
shall have original jurisdiction over . . . an action or proceeding [under the New York Convention],
regardless of the amount in controversy.” Id. § 203.
Chapter 2 also provides that “Chapter 1 applies to actions and proceedings brought under this chapter to
the extent that chapter is not in conflict with this chapter or the [New York] Convention as ratified by the
United States.” Id. § 208. Chapter 1, in turn, provides that “[a] written provision in . . . a contract
evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out
of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in
writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or
refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity
for the revocation of any contract.” Id. § 2. Chapter 1 further provides that “any party to the arbitration
may apply to the court so specified for an order confirming the award, and thereupon the court must grant
such an order unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11 of
[the FAA].” Id. § 9.

This arbitration option is intended to resolve individual disputes, and arbitral decisions are not
intended to function as persuasive or binding precedent in matters involving other parties,
including in future arbitrations or in EU or U.S. courts, or FTC proceedings.
F.

The Arbitration Panel

The parties will select the arbitrators from the list of arbitrators discussed below.
Consistent with applicable law, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European
Commission will develop a list of at least 20 arbitrators, chosen on the basis of independence,
integrity, and expertise. The following shall apply in connection with this process:
Arbitrators:
(1) will remain on the list for a period of 3 years, absent exceptional circumstances or for cause,
renewable for one additional period of 3 years;
(2) shall not be subject to any instructions from, or be affiliated with, either party, or any Privacy
Shield organization, or the U.S., EU, or any EU Member State or any other governmental
authority, public authority, or enforcement authority; and
(3) must be admitted to practice law in the U.S. and be experts in U.S. privacy law, with
expertise in EU data protection law.
G.

Arbitration Procedures

Consistent with applicable law, within 6 months from the adoption of the adequacy decision, the
Department of Commerce and the European Commission will agree to adopt an existing, wellestablished set of U.S. arbitral procedures (such as AAA or JAMS) to govern proceedings before
the Privacy Shield Panel, subject to each of the following considerations:
1. An individual may initiate binding arbitration, subject to the pre-arbitration requirements
provision above, by delivering a “Notice” to the organization. The Notice shall contain a
summary of steps taken under Paragraph C to resolve the claim, a description of the alleged
violation, and, at the choice of the individual, any supporting documents and materials and/or
a discussion of law relating to the alleged claim.
2. Procedures will be developed to ensure that an individual’s same claimed violation does not
receive duplicative remedies or procedures.
3. FTC action may proceed in parallel with arbitration.
4. No representative of the U.S., EU, or any EU Member State or any other governmental
authority, public authority, or enforcement authority may participate in these arbitrations,
provided, that at the request of an EU individual, EU DPAs may provide assistance in the
preparation only of the Notice but EU DPAs may not have access to discovery or any other
materials related to these arbitrations.
5. The location of the arbitration will be the United States, and the individual may choose video
or telephone participation, which will be provided at no cost to the individual. In-person
participation will not be required.

6. The language of the arbitration will be English unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Upon
a reasoned request, and taking into account whether the individual is represented by an
attorney, interpretation at the arbitral hearing as well as translation of arbitral materials will
be provided at no cost to the individual, unless the panel finds that, under the circumstances
of the specific arbitration, this would lead to unjustified or disproportionate costs.
7. Materials submitted to arbitrators will be treated confidentially and will only be used in
connection with the arbitration.
8. Individual-specific discovery may be permitted if necessary, and such discovery will be
treated confidentially by the parties and will only be used in connection with the arbitration.
9. Arbitrations should be completed within 90 days of the delivery of the Notice to the
organization at issue, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
H.

Costs

Arbitrators should take reasonable steps to minimize the costs or fees of the arbitrations.
Subject to applicable law, the Department of Commerce will facilitate the establishment of a
fund, into which Privacy Shield organizations will be required to pay an annual contribution,
based in part on the size of the organization, which will cover the arbitral cost, including
arbitrator fees, up to maximum amounts (“caps”), in consultation with the European
Commission. The fund will be managed by a third party, which will report regularly on the
operations of the fund. At the annual review, the Department of Commerce and European
Commission will review the operation of the fund, including the need to adjust the amount of the
contributions or of the caps, and will consider, among other things, the number of arbitrations
and the costs and timing of the arbitrations, with the mutual understanding that there will be no
excessive financial burden imposed on Privacy Shield organizations. Attorney’s fees are not
covered by this provision or any fund under this provision.

ANNEX A:
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield
Ombudsperson Mechanism

 

EU-U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD FRAMEWORK MECHANISM
REGARDING SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE
In recognition of the importance of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, this
Memorandum sets forth the process for implementing a new mechanism, consistent with
Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28), regarding signals intelligence.
On January 17, 2014, President Obama gave a speech announcing important intelligence
reforms. In that speech, he pointed out that “[o]ur efforts help protect not only our nation, but
our friends and allies as well. Our efforts will only be effective if ordinary citizens in other
countries have confidence that the United States respects their privacy too.” President Obama
announced the issuance of a new presidential directive—PPD-28—to “clearly prescribe what we
do, and do not do, when it comes to our overseas surveillance.”
Section 4(d) of PPD-28 directs the Secretary of State to designate a “Senior Coordinator for
International Information Technology Diplomacy” (Senior Coordinator) “to … serve as a point
of contact for foreign governments who wish to raise concerns regarding signals intelligence
activities conducted by the United States.” As of January 2015, Under Secretary C. Novelli has
served as the Senior Coordinator.
This Memorandum describes a new mechanism that the Senior Coordinator will follow to
facilitate the processing of requests relating to national security access to data transmitted from
the EU to the United States pursuant to the Privacy Shield, standard contractual clauses (SCCs),
binding corporate rules (BCRs), “Derogations,”1 or “Possible Future Derogations,”2 through
                                                            
1

“Derogations” in this context mean a commercial transfer or transfers that take place on the
condition that: (a) the data subject has given his consent unambiguously to the proposed
transfer; or (b) the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data
subject and the controller or the implementation of precontractual measures taken in response to
the data subject’s request; or (c) the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a
contract concluded in the interest of the data subject between the controller and a third party; or
(d) the transfer is necessary or legally required on important public interest grounds, or for the
establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or (e) the transfer is necessary in order to
protect the vital interests of the data subject; or (f) the transfer is made from a register which
according to laws or regulations is intended to provide information to the public and which is
open to consultation either by the public in general or by any person who can demonstrate
legitimate interest, to the extent that the conditions laid down in law for consultation are fulfilled
in the particular case.
2
“Possible Future Derogations” in this context mean a commercial transfer or transfers that take
place on one of the following conditions, to the extent the condition constitutes lawful grounds
for transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.S.: (a) the data subject has explicitly
consented to the proposed transfer, after having been informed of the possible risks of such
transfers for the data subject due to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate
 
1
 

 

established avenues under applicable United States laws and policy, and the response to those
requests.
1. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson. The Senior Coordinator will serve as the Privacy
Shield Ombudsperson and designate additional State Department officials, as appropriate to
assist in her performance of the responsibilities detailed in this memorandum. (Hereinafter,
the Coordinator and any officials performing such duties will be referred to as “Privacy
Shield Ombudsperson.”) The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will work closely with
appropriate officials from other departments and agencies who are responsible for processing
requests in accordance with applicable United States law and policy. The Under Secretary
reports directly to the Secretary of State, and is independent from the Intelligence
Community.
2. Effective Coordination. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will be able to effectively use
and coordinate with the mechanisms and officials described below, in order to ensure
appropriate response to communications from submitting EU individual complaint handing
body.
a. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will work closely with other United States
Government officials, including appropriate independent oversight bodies, to ensure that
completed requests are processed and resolved in accordance with applicable laws and
policies. In particular, the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will be able to coordinate
closely with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of
Justice, and other departments and agencies involved in United States national security as
appropriate, and Inspectors General, Freedom of Information Act Officers, and Civil
Liberties and Privacy Officers.
b. The United States Government will rely on mechanisms for coordinating and overseeing
national security matters across departments and agencies to help ensure that the Privacy
Shield Ombudsperson is able to respond within the meaning of Section 4(e) to completed
requests under Section 3(b).
c. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson may refer matters related to requests to the Privacy
and Civil Liberties Oversight Board for its consideration.
                                                                                                                                                                                                

safeguards; or (b) the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject
or of other persons, where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent; or
(c) where a transfer to a third country or an international organization may take place only if the
transfer is not repetitive, concerns only a limited number of data subjects, is necessary for the
purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller which are not overridden
by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject, where the controller has assessed all
the circumstances surrounding the data transfer and based on this assessment adduced suitable
safeguards with respect to the protection of personal data.
2
 

 

3. Submitting Requests.
a. A request will initially be submitted to the Member States bodies competent for the
oversight of national security services. The EU reserves the possibility to designate a
centralized EU individual complaint handling body to which a request can also be
submitted (hereafter together or alternatively: the “EU individual complaint handling
body”).
b. The EU individual complaint handling body will ensure, in compliance with the
following actions, that the request is complete:
(i)

Verifying the identity of the individual, and that the individual is acting on his/her
own behalf, and not as a representative of a governmental or intergovernmental
organization.
(ii) Ensuring the request is made in writing, and that it contains the following basic
information:
 any information that forms the basis for the request,
 the nature of information or relief sought,
 the United States Government entities believed to be involved, if any, and
 the other measures pursued to obtain the information or relief requested and the
response received through those other measures.
(iii) Verifying that the request pertains to data reasonably believed to have been
transferred from the EU to the United States pursuant to the Privacy Shield, SCCs,
BCRs, Derogations, or Possible Future Derogations.
(iv) Making an initial determination that the request is not frivolous, vexatious, or made
in bad faith.

c. To be completed for purposes of further handling by the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson
under this memorandum, the request need not demonstrate that the requester’s data has in
fact been accessed by the United States Government through signal intelligence activities.
4. Commitments to Communicate with Submitting EU Individual Complaint Handling
Body.
a. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will acknowledge receipt of the request to the
submitting EU individual complaint handling body.
b. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will conduct an initial review to verify that the
request has been completed in conformance with Section 3(b). If the Privacy Shield
Ombudsperson notes any deficiencies or has any questions regarding the completion of
the request, the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will seek to address and resolve those
concerns with the submitting EU individual complaint handling body.
3
 

 

c. If, to facilitate appropriate processing of the request, the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson
needs more information about the request, or if specific action is needed to be taken by
the individual who originally submitted the request, the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson
will so inform the submitting EU individual complaint handling body.
d. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will track the status of requests and provide updates
as appropriate to the submitting EU individual complaint handling body.
e. Once a request has been completed as described in Section 3 of this Memorandum, the
Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will provide in a timely manner an appropriate response to
the submitting EU individual complaint handling body, subject to the continuing
obligation to protect information under applicable laws and policies. The Privacy Shield
Ombudsperson will provide a response to the submitting EU individual complaint
handling body confirming (i) that the complaint has been properly investigated, and (ii)
that the U.S. law, statutes, executives orders, presidential directives, and agency policies,
providing the limitations and safeguards described in the ODNI letter, have been
complied with, or, in the event of non-compliance, such non-compliance has been
remedied. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will neither confirm nor deny whether the
individual has been the target of surveillance nor will the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson
confirm the specific remedy that was applied. As further explained in Section 5, FOIA
requests will be processed as provided under that statute and applicable regulations.
f. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson will communicate directly with the EU individual
complaint handling body, who will in turn be responsible for communicating with the
individual submitting the request. If direct communications are part of one of the
underlying processes described below, then those communications will take place in
accordance with existing procedures.
g. Commitments in this Memorandum will not apply to general claims that the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield is inconsistent with European Union data protection requirements. The
commitments in this Memorandum are made based on the common understanding by the
European Commission and the U.S. government that given the scope of commitments
under this mechanism, there may be resource constraints that arise, including with respect
to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Should the carrying-out of the Privacy
Shield Ombudsperson’s functions exceed reasonable resource constraints and impede the
fulfillment of these commitments, the U.S. government will discuss with the European
Commission any adjustments that may be appropriate to address the situation.
5. Requests for Information. Requests for access to United States Government records may
be made and processed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

4
 

 

a. FOIA provides a means for any person to seek access to existing federal agency records,
regardless of the nationality of the requester. This statute is codified in the United States
Code at 5 U.S.C. § 552. The statute, together with additional information about FOIA, is
available at www.FOIA.gov and http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-resources. Each agency
has a Chief FOIA Officer, and has provided information on its public website about how
to submit a FOIA request to the agency. Agencies have processes for consulting with one
another on FOIA requests that involve records held by another agency.
b. By way of example:
(i)

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has established the
ODNI FOIA Portal for the ODNI: http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about-thissite/foia. This portal provides information on submitting a request, checking on the
status of an existing request, and accessing information that has been released and
published by the ODNI under FOIA. The ODNI FOIA Portal includes links to other
FOIA websites for IC elements: http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about-thissite/foia/other-ic-foia-sites.

(ii) The Department of Justice’s Office of Information Policy provides comprehensive
information about FOIA: http://www.justice.gov/oip. This includes not only
information about submitting a FOIA request to the Department of Justice, but also
provides guidance to the United States government on interpreting and applying
FOIA requirements.
c. Under FOIA, access to government records is subject to certain enumerated exemptions.
These include limits on access to classified national security information, personal
information of third parties, and information concerning law enforcement investigations,
and are comparable to the limitations imposed by each EU Member State with its own
information access law. These limitations apply equally to Americans and nonAmericans.
d. Disputes over the release of records requested pursuant to FOIA can be appealed
administratively and then in federal court. The court is required to make a de novo
determination of whether records are properly withheld, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B), and can
compel the government to provide access to records. In some cases courts have
overturned government assertions that information should be withheld as classified.
Although no monetary damages are available, courts can award attorney’s fees.
6. Requests for Further Action. A request alleging violation of law or other misconduct will
be referred to the appropriate United States Government body, including independent
oversight bodies, with the power to investigate the respective request and address noncompliance as described below.

5
 

 

a. Inspectors General are statutorily independent; have broad power to conduct
investigations, audits and reviews of programs, including of fraud and abuse or violation
of law; and can recommend corrective actions.
(i)

The Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, statutorily established the Federal
Inspectors General (IG) as independent and objective units within most agencies
whose duties are to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in the programs and operations
of their respective agencies. To this end, each IG is responsible for conducting
audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of its
agency. Additionally, IGs provide leadership and coordination and recommend
policies for activities designed to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness,
and prevent and detect fraud and abuse, in agency programs and operations.

(ii) Each element of the Intelligence Community has its own Office of the Inspector
General with responsibility for oversight of foreign intelligence activities, among
other matters. A number of Inspector General reports about intelligence programs
have been publicly released.
(iii) By way of example:


The Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (IC IG) was
established pursuant to Section 405 of the Intelligence Authorization Act of Fiscal
Year 2010. The IC IG is responsible for conducting IC-wide audits,
investigations, inspections, and reviews that identify and address systemic risks,
vulnerabilities, and deficiencies that cut across IC agency missions, in order to
positively impact IC-wide economies and efficiencies. The IC IG is authorized to
investigate complaints or information concerning allegations of a violation of law,
rule, regulation, waste, fraud, abuse of authority, or a substantial or specific
danger to public health and safety in connection with ODNI and/or IC intelligence
programs and activities. The IC IG provides information on how to contact the IC
IG directly to submit a report: http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about-thissite/contact-the-ig.



The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in the U.S. Department of Justice
(DOJ) is a statutorily created independent entity whose mission is to detect and
deter waste, fraud, abuse, and misconduct in DOJ programs and personnel, and to
promote economy and efficiency in those programs. The OIG investigates
alleged violations of criminal and civil laws by DOJ employees and also audits
and inspects DOJ programs. The OIG has jurisdiction over all complaints of
misconduct against Department of Justice employees, including the Federal
Bureau of Investigation; Drug Enforcement Administration; Federal Bureau of
Prisons; U.S. Marshals Service; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and
Explosives; United States Attorneys Offices; and employees who work in other
6

 

 

Divisions or Offices in the Department of Justice. (The one exception is that
allegations of misconduct by a Department attorney or law enforcement personnel
that relate to the exercise of the Department attorney’s authority to investigate,
litigate, or provide legal advice are the responsibility of the Department’s Office
of Professional Responsibility.) In addition, section 1001 of the USA Patriot Act,
signed into law on October 26, 2001, directs the Inspector General to review
information and receive complaints alleging abuses of civil rights and civil
liberties by Department of Justice employees. The OIG maintains a public
website – https://www.oig.justice.gov – which includes a “Hotline” for submitting
complaints – https://www.oig.justice.gov/hotline/index.htm.
b. Privacy and Civil Liberties offices and entities in the United States Government also have
relevant responsibilities. By way of example:
(i)

Section 803 of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of
2007, codified in the United States Code at 42 U.S.C. § 2000-ee1, establishes
privacy and civil liberties officers at certain departments and agencies (including the
Department of State, Department of Justice, and ODNI). Section 803 specifies that
these privacy and civil liberties officers will serve as the principal advisor to, among
other things, ensure that such department, agency, or element has adequate
procedures to address complaints from individuals who allege such department,
agency, or element has violated their privacy or civil liberties.

(ii) The ODNI’s Civil Liberties and Privacy Office (ODNI CLPO) is led by the ODNI
Civil Liberties Protection Officer, a position established by the National Security
Act of 1948, as amended. The duties of the ODNI CLPO include ensuring that the
policies and procedures of the elements of the Intelligence Community include
adequate protections for privacy and civil liberties, and reviewing and investigating
complaints alleging abuse or violation of civil liberties and privacy in ODNI
programs and activities. The ODNI CLPO provides information to the public on its
website, including instructions for how to submit a complaint: www.dni.gov/clpo.
If the ODNI CLPO receives a privacy or civil liberties complaint involving IC
programs and activities, it will coordinate with other IC elements on how that
complaint should be further processed within the IC. Note that the National
Security Agency (NSA) also has a Civil Liberties and Privacy Office, which
provides information about its responsibilities on its website –
https://www.nsa.gov/civil_liberties/. If information indicates that an agency is out
of compliance with privacy requirements (e.g., a requirement under Section 4 of
PPD-28), then agencies have compliance mechanisms to review and remedy the
incident. Agencies are required to report compliance incidents under PPD-28 to the
ODNI.

7
 

 

(iii) The Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties (OPCL) at the Department of Justice
supports the duties and responsibilities of the Department’s Chief Privacy and Civil
Liberties Officer (CPCLO). The principal mission of OPCL is to protect the privacy
and civil liberties of the American people through review, oversight, and
coordination of the Department’s privacy operations. OPCL provides legal advice
and guidance to Departmental components; ensures the Department’s privacy
compliance, including compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974, the privacy
provisions of both the E-Government Act of 2002 and the Federal Information
Security Management Act, as well as administration policy directives issued in
furtherance of those Acts; develops and provides Departmental privacy training;
assists the CPCLO in developing Departmental privacy policy; prepares privacyrelated reporting to the President and Congress; and reviews the information
handling practices of the Department to ensure that such practices are consistent
with the protection of privacy and civil liberties. OPCL provides information to the
public about its responsibilities at http://www.justice.gov/opcl.
(iv) According to 42 U.S.C. § 2000ee et seq., the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight
Board shall continually review (i) the policies and procedures, as well as their
implementation, of the departments, agencies and elements of the executive branch
relating to efforts to protect the Nation from terrorism to ensure that privacy and
civil liberties are protected, and (ii) other actions by the executive branch relating to
such efforts to determine whether such actions appropriately protect privacy and
civil liberties and are consistent with governing laws, regulations, and policies
regarding privacy and civil liberties. It shall receive and review reports and other
information from privacy officers and civil liberties officers and, when appropriate,
make recommendations to them regarding their activities. Section 803 of the
Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, codified at
42 U.S.C. § 2000ee-1, directs the privacy and civil liberties officers of eight federal
agencies (including the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Homeland Security,
Director of National Intelligence, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency),
and any additional agency designated by the Board, to submit periodic reports to the
PCLOB, including the number, nature, and disposition of the complaints received
by the respective agency for alleged violations. The PCLOB’s enabling statute
directs the Board to receive these reports and, when appropriate, make
recommendations to the privacy and civil liberties officers regarding their activities.

Letter from
Federal Trade Commission
Chairwoman Edith Ramirez

United States of America

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
WASHINGTON, DC 20580

OFFICE OF CHAIRWOMAN
EDITH RAMIREZ

February 23, 2016

VIA EMAIL
Věra Jourová
Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality
European Commission
Rue de la Loi / Wetstraat 200
1049 Brussels
Belgium
Dear Commissioner Jourová:
The United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) appreciates the opportunity to
describe its enforcement of the new EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (the “Privacy Shield
Framework” or “Framework”). We believe the Framework will play a critical role in facilitating
privacy-protective commercial transactions in an increasingly interconnected world. It will
enable businesses to conduct important operations in the global economy, while at the same time
ensuring that EU consumers retain important privacy protections. The FTC has long committed
to protecting privacy across borders and will make enforcement of the new Framework a high
priority. Below, we explain the FTC’s history of strong privacy enforcement generally,
including our enforcement of the original Safe Harbor program, as well as the FTC’s approach to
enforcement of the new Framework.
The FTC first publicly expressed its commitment to enforce the Safe Harbor program in
2000. At that time, then-FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky sent the European Commission a letter
outlining the FTC’s pledge to vigorously enforce the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. The FTC
has continued to uphold this commitment through nearly 40 enforcement actions, numerous
additional investigations, and cooperation with individual European data protection authorities
(“EU DPAs”) on matters of mutual interest.
After the European Commission raised concerns in November 2013 about the
administration and enforcement of the Safe Harbor program, we and the U.S. Department of
Commerce began consultations with officials from the European Commission to explore ways to
strengthen it. While those consultations were proceeding, on October 6, 2015, the European
Court of Justice issued a decision in the Schrems case that, among other things, invalidated the
European Commission’s decision on the adequacy of the Safe Harbor program. Following the
decision, we continued to work closely with the Department of Commerce and the European

Commission in an effort to strengthen the privacy protections provided to EU citizens. The
Privacy Shield Framework is a result of these ongoing consultations. As was the case with the
Safe Harbor program, the FTC hereby commits to vigorous enforcement of the new Framework.
This letter memorializes that commitment.
Notably, we affirm our commitment in four key areas: (1) referral prioritization and
investigations; (2) addressing false or deceptive Privacy Shield membership claims;
(3) continued order monitoring; and (4) enhanced engagement and enforcement cooperation with
EU DPAs. We provide below detailed information about each of these commitments and
relevant background about the FTC’s role in protecting consumer privacy and enforcing Safe
Harbor, as well as the broader privacy landscape in the United States.1
I.

Background
A.

FTC Privacy Enforcement and Policy Work

The FTC has broad civil enforcement authority to promote consumer protection and
competition in the commercial sphere. As part of its consumer protection mandate, the FTC
enforces a wide range of laws to protect the privacy and security of consumer data. The primary
law enforced by the FTC, the FTC Act, prohibits “unfair” and “deceptive” acts or practices in or
affecting commerce.2 A representation, omission, or practice is deceptive if it is material and
likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.3 An act or practice is
unfair if it causes, or is likely to cause, substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable by
consumers or outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.4 The FTC
also enforces targeted statutes that protect information relating to health, credit and other
financial matters, as well as children’s online information, and has issued regulations
implementing each of these statutes.
The FTC’s jurisdiction under the FTC Act applies to matters “in or affecting commerce.”
The FTC does not have jurisdiction over criminal law enforcement or national security matters.
Nor can the FTC reach most other governmental actions. In addition, there are exceptions to the
FTC’s jurisdiction over commercial activities, including with respect to banks, airlines, the
business of insurance, and the common carrier activities of telecommunications service
providers. The FTC also does not have jurisdiction over most non-profit organizations, but it
does have jurisdiction over sham charities or other non-profits that in actuality operate for profit.
The FTC also has jurisdiction over non-profit organizations that operate for the profit of their
for-profit members, including by providing substantial economic benefits to those members.5 In
some instances, the FTC’s jurisdiction is concurrent with that of other law enforcement agencies.

our recent privacy and security enforcement actions in Attachment B. This summary is also available on the FTC’s

We have developed strong working relationships with federal and state authorities and work
closely with them to coordinate investigations or make referrals where appropriate.
Enforcement is the lynchpin of the FTC’s approach to privacy protection. To date, the
FTC has brought over 500 cases protecting the privacy and security of consumer information.
This body of cases covers both offline and online information and includes enforcement actions
against companies large and small, alleging that they failed to properly dispose of sensitive
consumer data, failed to secure consumers’ personal information, deceptively tracked consumers
online, spammed consumers, installed spyware or other malware on consumers’ computers,
violated Do Not Call and other telemarketing rules, and improperly collected and shared
consumer information on mobile devices. The FTC’s enforcement actions—in both the physical
and digital worlds—send an important message to companies about the need to protect consumer
privacy.
The FTC has also pursued numerous policy initiatives aimed at enhancing consumer
privacy that inform its enforcement work. The FTC has hosted workshops and issued reports
recommending best practices aimed at improving privacy in the mobile ecosystem; increasing
transparency of the data broker industry; maximizing the benefits of big data while mitigating its
risks, particularly for low-income and underserved consumers; and highlighting the privacy and
security implications of facial recognition and the Internet of Things, among other areas.
The FTC also engages in consumer and business education to enhance the impact of its
enforcement and policy development initiatives. The FTC has used a variety of tools—
publications, online resources, workshops, and social media—to provide educational materials
on a wide range of topics, including mobile apps, children’s privacy, and data security. Most
recently, the Commission launched its “Start With Security” initiative, which includes new
guidance for businesses drawing on lessons learned from the agency’s data security cases, as
well as a series of workshops across the country. In addition, the FTC has long been a leader in
educating consumers about basic computer security. Last year, our OnGuard Online site and its
Spanish language counterpart, Alerta en Línea, had more than 5 million page views.
B.

U.S. Legal Protections Benefiting EU Consumers

The Framework will operate in the context of the larger U.S. privacy landscape, which
protects EU consumers in a number of ways.
The FTC Act’s prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices is not limited to
protecting U.S. consumers from U.S. companies, as it includes those practices that (1) cause or
are likely to cause reasonably foreseeable injury in the United States, or (2) involve material
conduct in the United States. Further, the FTC can use all remedies, including restitution, that
are available to protect domestic consumers when protecting foreign consumers.
Indeed, the FTC’s enforcement work significantly benefits both U.S. and foreign
consumers. For example, our cases enforcing Section 5 of the FTC Act have protected the
privacy of U.S. and foreign consumers alike. In a case against an information broker,
Accusearch, the FTC alleged that the company’s sale of confidential telephone records to third
3

parties without consumers’ knowledge or consent was an unfair practice in violation of Section 5
of the FTC Act. Accusearch sold information relating to both U.S. and foreign consumers.6 The
court granted injunctive relief against Accusearch prohibiting, among other things, the marketing
or sale of consumers’ personal information without written consent, unless it was lawfully
obtained from publicly available information, and ordered disgorgement of almost $200,000.7
The FTC’s settlement with TRUSTe is another example. It ensures that consumers,
including those in the European Union, can rely on representations that a global self-regulatory
organization makes about its review and certification of domestic and foreign online services.8
Importantly, our action against TRUSTe also strengthens the privacy self-regulatory system
more broadly by ensuring the accountability of entities that play an important role in selfregulatory schemes, including cross-border privacy frameworks.
The FTC also enforces other targeted laws whose protections extend to non-U.S.
consumers, such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). Among other
things, COPPA requires that operators of child-directed websites and online services, or general
audience sites that knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13,
provide parental notice and obtain verifiable parental consent. U.S.-based websites and services
that are subject to COPPA and collect personal information from foreign children are required to
comply with COPPA. Foreign-based websites and online services must also comply with
COPPA if they are directed to children in the United States, or if they knowingly collect personal
information from children in the United States. In addition to the U.S. federal laws enforced by
the FTC, certain other federal and state consumer protection and privacy laws may provide
additional benefits to EU consumers.
C.

Safe Harbor Enforcement

As part of its privacy and security enforcement program, the FTC has also sought to
protect EU consumers by bringing enforcement actions that involved Safe Harbor violations.
The FTC has brought 39 Safe Harbor enforcement actions: 36 alleging false certification claims,
and three cases—against Google, Facebook, and Myspace—involving alleged violations of Safe
Harbor Privacy Principles.9 These cases demonstrate the enforceability of certifications and the
repercussions for non-compliance. Twenty-year consent orders require Google, Facebook, and
Myspace to implement comprehensive privacy programs that must be reasonably designed to
address privacy risks related to the development and management of new and existing products

business as Abika.com, https://www.priv.gc.ca/cf-dc/2009/2009 009 0731 e.asp. The Office of the Privacy
Commissioner of Canada filed an amicus curiae brief in the appeal of the FTC action and conducted its own
investigation, concluding that Accusearch’s practices also violated Canadian law.

and services and to protect the privacy and confidentiality of personal information. The
comprehensive privacy programs mandated under these orders must identify foreseeable material
risks and have controls to address those risks. The companies must also submit to ongoing,
independent assessments of their privacy programs, which must be provided to the FTC. The
orders also prohibit these companies from misrepresenting their privacy practices and their
participation in any privacy or security program. This prohibition would also apply to
companies’ acts and practices under the new Privacy Shield Framework. The FTC can enforce
these orders by seeking civil penalties. In fact, Google paid a record $22.5 million civil penalty
in 2012 to resolve allegations it had violated its order. Consequently, these FTC orders help
protect over a billion consumers worldwide, hundreds of millions of whom reside in Europe.
The FTC’s cases have also focused on false, deceptive, or misleading claims of Safe
Harbor participation. The FTC takes these claims seriously. For example, in FTC v. Karnani,
the FTC brought an action in 2011 against an Internet marketer in the United States alleging that
he and his company tricked British consumers into believing that the company was based in the
United Kingdom, including by using .uk web extensions and referencing British currency and the
UK postal system.10 However, when consumers received the products, they discovered
unexpected import duties, warranties that were not valid in the United Kingdom, and charges
associated with obtaining refunds. The FTC also charged that the defendants deceived
consumers about their participation in the Safe Harbor program. Notably, all of the consumer
victims were in the United Kingdom.
Many of our other Safe Harbor enforcement cases involved organizations that joined the
Safe Harbor program but failed to renew their annual certification while they continued to
represent themselves as current members. As discussed further below, the FTC also commits to
addressing false claims of participation in the Privacy Shield Framework. This strategic
enforcement activity will complement the Department of Commerce’s increased actions to verify
compliance with program requirements for certification and re-certification, its monitoring of
effective compliance, including through the use of questionnaires to Framework participants, and
its increased efforts to identify false Framework membership claims and misuse of any
Framework certification mark.11
II.

Referral Prioritization and Investigations

As we did under the Safe Harbor program, the FTC commits to give priority to Privacy
Shield referrals from EU Member States. We will also prioritize referrals of non-compliance
with self-regulatory guidelines relating to the Privacy Shield Framework from privacy selfregulatory organizations and other independent dispute resolution bodies.

Administration, to Věra Jourová, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality (Feb. 23, 2016).

To facilitate referrals under the Framework from EU Member States, the FTC is creating
a standardized referral process and providing guidance to EU Member States on the type of
information that would best assist the FTC in its inquiry into a referral. As part of this effort, the
FTC will designate an agency point of contact for EU Member State referrals. It is most useful
when the referring authority has conducted a preliminary inquiry into the alleged violation and
can cooperate with the FTC in an investigation.
Upon receipt of a referral from an EU Member State or self-regulatory organization, the
FTC can take a range of actions to address the issues raised. For example, we may review the
company’s privacy policies, obtain further information directly from the company or from third
parties, follow up with the referring entity, assess whether there is a pattern of violations or
significant number of consumers affected, determine whether the referral implicates issues
within the purview of the Department of Commerce, assess whether consumer and business
education would be helpful, and, as appropriate, initiate an enforcement proceeding.
The FTC also commits to exchange information on referrals with referring enforcement
authorities, including the status of referrals, subject to confidentiality laws and restrictions. To
the extent feasible given the number and type of referrals received, the information provided will
include an evaluation of the referred matters, including a description of significant issues raised
and any action taken to address law violations within the jurisdiction of the FTC. The FTC will
also provide feedback to the referring authority on the types of referrals received in order to
increase the effectiveness of efforts to address unlawful conduct. If a referring enforcement
authority seeks information about the status of a particular referral for purposes of pursuing its
own enforcement proceeding, the FTC will respond, taking into account the number of referrals
under consideration and subject to confidentiality and other legal requirements.
The FTC will also work closely with EU DPAs to provide enforcement assistance. In
appropriate cases, this could include information sharing and investigative assistance pursuant to
the U.S. SAFE WEB Act, which authorizes FTC assistance to foreign law enforcement agencies
when the foreign agency is enforcing laws prohibiting practices that are substantially similar to
those prohibited by laws the FTC enforces.12 As part of this assistance, the FTC can share
information obtained in connection with an FTC investigation, issue compulsory process on
behalf of the EU DPA conducting its own investigation, and seek oral testimony from witnesses
or defendants in connection with the DPA’s enforcement proceeding, subject to the requirements
of the U.S. SAFE WEB Act. The FTC regularly uses this authority to assist other authorities
around the world in privacy and consumer protection cases.13

12

In determining whether to exercise its U.S. SAFE WEB Act authority, the FTC considers, inter alia: “(A) whether
the requesting agency has agreed to provide or will provide reciprocal assistance to the Commission; (B) whether
compliance with the request would prejudice the public interest of the United States; and (C) whether the requesting
agency’s investigation or enforcement proceeding concerns acts or practices that cause or are likely to cause injury
to a significant number of persons.” 15 U.S.C. § 46(j)(3). This authority does not apply to enforcement of
competition laws.
13
In fiscal years 2012-2015, for example, the FTC used its U.S. SAFE WEB Act authority to share information in
response to almost 60 requests from foreign agencies and it issued nearly 60 civil investigative demands (equivalent
to administrative subpoenas) to aid 25 foreign investigations.

6

In addition to prioritizing Privacy Shield referrals from EU Member States and privacy
self-regulatory organizations,14 the FTC commits to investigating possible Framework violations
on its own initiative where appropriate using a range of tools.
For well over a decade, the FTC has maintained a robust program of investigating
privacy and security issues involving commercial organizations. As part of these investigations,
the FTC routinely examined whether the entity at issue was making Safe Harbor representations.
If the entity was making such representations and the investigation revealed apparent violations
of the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, the FTC included allegations of Safe Harbor violations in
its enforcement actions. We will continue this proactive approach under the new Framework.
Importantly, the FTC conducts many more investigations than ultimately result in public
enforcement actions. Many FTC investigations are closed because staff does not identify an
apparent law violation. Because FTC investigations are non-public and confidential, the closing
of an investigation is often not made public.
The nearly 40 enforcement actions initiated by the FTC involving the Safe Harbor
program evidence the agency’s commitment to proactive enforcement of cross-border privacy
programs. The FTC will look for potential Framework violations as part of the privacy and
security investigations we undertake on a regular basis.
III.

Addressing False or Deceptive Privacy Shield Membership Claims

As referenced above, the FTC will take action against entities that misrepresent their
participation in the Framework. The FTC will give priority consideration to referrals from the
Department of Commerce regarding organizations that it identifies as improperly holding
themselves out to be current members of the Framework or using any Framework certification
mark without authorization.
In addition, we note that if an organization’s privacy policy promises that it complies
with the Privacy Shield Principles, its failure to make or maintain a registration with the
Department of Commerce likely will not, by itself, excuse the organization from FTC
enforcement of those Framework commitments.
IV.

Order Monitoring

The FTC also affirms its commitment to monitor enforcement orders to ensure
compliance with the Privacy Shield Framework.
We will require compliance with the Framework through a variety of appropriate
injunctive provisions in future FTC Framework orders. This includes prohibiting
14

Although the FTC does not resolve or mediate individual consumer complaints, the FTC affirms that it will
prioritize Privacy Shield referrals from EU DPAs. In addition, the FTC uses complaints in its Consumer Sentinel
database, which is accessible by many other law enforcement agencies, to identify trends, determine enforcement
priorities, and identify potential investigative targets. EU citizens can use the same complaint system available to
U.S. citizens to submit a complaint to the FTC at www ftc.gov/complaint. For individual Privacy Shield complaints,
however, it may be most useful for EU citizens to submit complaints to their Member State DPA or alternative
dispute resolution provider.

misrepresentations regarding the Framework and other privacy programs when these are the
basis for the underlying FTC action.
The FTC’s cases enforcing the original Safe Harbor program are instructive. In the 36
cases involving false or deceptive claims of Safe Harbor certification, each order prohibits the
defendant from misrepresenting its participation in Safe Harbor or any other privacy or security
program and requires the company to make compliance reports available to the FTC. In cases
that involved violations of Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, companies have been required to
implement comprehensive privacy programs and obtain independent third-party assessments of
those programs every other year for twenty years, which they must provide to the FTC.
Violations of the FTC’s administrative orders can lead to civil penalties of up to $16,000
per violation, or $16,000 per day for a continuing violation,15 which, in the case of practices
affecting many consumers, can amount to millions of dollars. Each consent order also has
reporting and compliance provisions. The entities under order must retain documents
demonstrating their compliance for a specified number of years. The orders must also be
disseminated to employees responsible for ensuring order compliance.
The FTC systematically monitors compliance with Safe Harbor orders, as it does with all
of its orders. The FTC takes enforcement of its privacy and data security orders seriously and
brings actions to enforce them when necessary. For example, as noted above, Google paid a
$22.5 million civil penalty to resolve allegations it had violated its FTC order. Importantly, FTC
orders will continue to protect all consumers worldwide who interact with a business, not just
those consumers who have lodged complaints.
Finally, the FTC will continue to maintain an online list of companies subject to orders
obtained in connection with enforcement of both the Safe Harbor program and the new Privacy
Shield Framework.16 In addition, the Privacy Shield Principles now require companies subject to
an FTC or court order based on non-compliance with the Principles to make public any relevant
Framework-related sections of any compliance or assessment report submitted to the FTC, to the
extent consistent with confidentiality laws and rules.
V.

Engagement With EU DPAs and Enforcement Cooperation

The FTC recognizes the important role that EU DPAs play with respect to Framework
compliance and encourages increased consultation and enforcement cooperation. In addition to
any consultation with referring DPAs on case-specific matters, the FTC commits to participate in
periodic meetings with designated representatives of the Article 29 Working Party to discuss in
general terms how to improve enforcement cooperation with respect to the Framework. The
FTC will also participate, along with the Department of Commerce, the European Commission,
and Article 29 Working Party representatives, in the annual review of the Framework to discuss
its implementation.

The FTC also encourages the development of tools that will enhance enforcement
cooperation with EU DPAs, as well as other privacy enforcement authorities around the world.
In particular, the FTC, along with enforcement partners in the European Union and around the
globe, last year launched an alert system within the Global Privacy Enforcement Network
(“GPEN”) to share information about investigations and promote enforcement coordination.
This GPEN Alert tool could be particularly useful in the context of the Privacy Shield
Framework. The FTC and EU DPAs could use it to coordinate with respect to the Framework
and other privacy investigations, including as a starting point for sharing information in order to
deliver coordinated and more effective privacy protection for consumers. We look forward to
continuing to work with participating EU authorities to deploy the GPEN Alert system more
broadly and develop other tools to improve enforcement cooperation in privacy cases, including
those involving the Framework.
***
The FTC is pleased to affirm its commitment to enforcing the new Privacy Shield
Framework. We also look forward to continuing engagement with our EU colleagues as we
work together to protect consumer privacy on both sides of the Atlantic.
Sincerely,

Edith Ramirez
Chairwoman

The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework in Context:
An Overview of the U.S. Privacy and Security Landscape
The protections provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (the “Framework”)
exist in the context of the broader privacy protections afforded under the U.S. legal system as a
whole. First, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has a robust privacy and data security
program for U.S. commercial practices that protects consumers worldwide. Second, the
landscape of consumer privacy and security protection in the United States has evolved
substantially since 2000 when the original U.S.-EU Safe Harbor program was adopted. Since
that time, many federal and state privacy and security laws have been enacted, and public and
private litigation to enforce privacy rights has increased significantly. The broad scope of U.S.
legal protections for consumer privacy and security applicable to commercial data practices
complements the protections provided to EU citizens by the new Framework.
I.

The FTC’s General Privacy and Security Enforcement Program

The FTC is the leading U.S. consumer protection agency focused on commercial sector
privacy. The FTC has authority to prosecute unfair and deceptive acts or practices that violate
consumer privacy, as well as to enforce more targeted privacy laws that protect certain financial
and health information, information about children, and information used to make certain
eligibility decisions about consumers.
The FTC has unparalleled experience in consumer privacy enforcement. The FTC’s
enforcement actions have addressed unlawful practices in offline and online environments. For
example, the FTC has brought enforcement actions against well-known companies, such as
Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Wyndham, Oracle, HTC, and Snapchat, as well as lesserknown companies. The FTC has sued businesses that allegedly spammed consumers, installed
spyware on computers, failed to secure consumers’ personal information, deceptively tracked
consumers online, violated children’s privacy, unlawfully collected information on consumers’
mobile devices, and failed to secure Internet-connected devices used to store personal
information. The resulting orders have typically provided for ongoing monitoring by the FTC
for a period of twenty years, prohibited further law violations, and subjected the businesses to
substantial financial penalties for order violations. 1 Importantly, FTC orders do not just protect
the individuals who may have complained about a problem; rather, they protect all consumers
dealing with the business going forward. In the cross-border context, the FTC has jurisdiction to
protect consumers worldwide from practices taking place in the United States. 2
To date, the FTC has brought over 130 spam and spyware cases, over 120 “Do Not Call”
telemarketing cases, over 100 Fair Credit Reporting Act actions, almost 60 data security cases,
more than 50 general privacy actions, almost 30 cases for violations of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
1

Any entity that fails to comply with an FTC order is subject to a civil penalty of up to $16,000 per violation, or
$16,000 per day for a continuing violation. See 15 U.S.C. § 45(l); 16 C.F.R. § 1.98(c).
2
Congress has expressly affirmed the FTC’s authority to seek legal remedies, including restitution, for any acts or
practices involving foreign commerce that (1) cause or are likely to cause reasonably foreseeable injury in the
United States, or (2) involve material conduct occurring within the United States. See 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(4).

Act, and over 20 actions enforcing the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). 3
In addition to these cases, the FTC has also issued and publicized warning letters. 4
As part of its history of strong privacy enforcement, the FTC has also regularly looked
for potential violations of the Safe Harbor program. Since the Safe Harbor program was
adopted, the FTC has undertaken numerous investigations into Safe Harbor compliance on its
own initiative and has brought 39 cases against U.S. companies for Safe Harbor violations. The
FTC will continue this proactive approach by making enforcement of the new Framework a
priority.
II.

Federal and State Protections for Consumer Privacy

The Safe Harbor Enforcement Overview, which appears as an annex to the European
Commission’s Safe Harbor adequacy decision, provides a summary of many of the federal and
state privacy laws in place at the time the Safe Harbor program was adopted in 2000. 5 At that
time, many federal statutes regulated the commercial collection and use of personal information,
beyond Section 5 of the FTC Act, including: the Cable Communications Policy Act, the Driver's
Privacy Protection Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Electronic Funds
Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Right to Financial
Privacy Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and the Video Privacy Protection Act.
Many states had analogous laws in these areas as well.
Since 2000, there have been numerous developments at both the federal and state level
that provide additional consumer privacy protections. 6 At the federal level, for example, the
FTC amended the COPPA Rule in 2013 to provide a number of additional protections for
children’s personal information. The FTC also issued two rules implementing the GrammLeach-Bliley Act – the Privacy Rule and the Safeguards Rule – which require financial

3

In some instances, the Commission’s privacy and data security cases allege that a company engaged in
both deceptive and unfair practices; these cases also sometimes involve alleged violations of multiple
statutes, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and COPPA.

institutions 7 to make disclosures about their information sharing practices and to implement a
comprehensive information security program to protect consumer information. 8 Similarly, the
Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (“FACTA”), enacted in 2003, supplements
longstanding U.S. credit laws to establish requirements for the masking, sharing, and disposal of
certain sensitive financial data. The FTC promulgated a number of rules under FACTA
regarding, among other things, consumers’ right to a free annual credit report; secure disposal
requirements for consumer report information; consumers’ right to opt out of receiving certain
offers of credit and insurance; consumers’ right to opt out of the use of information provided by
an affiliated company to market its products and services; and requirements for financial
institutions and creditors to implement identity theft detection and prevention programs. 9 In
addition, rules promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act were
revised in 2013, adding additional safeguards to protect the privacy and security of personal
health information. 10 Rules protecting consumers from unwanted telemarketing calls, robocalls,
and spam have also gone into effect. Congress has also enacted laws requiring certain
companies that collect health information to provide consumers with notification in the event of
a breach. 11
States have also been very active in passing laws related to privacy and security. Since
2000, forty-seven states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands
have enacted laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches of personal
information. 12 At least thirty-two states and Puerto Rico have data disposal laws, establishing
requirements for the destruction or disposal of personal information. 13 A number of states also
have enacted general data security laws. In addition, California has enacted various privacy
laws, including a law requiring companies to have privacy policies and disclose their Do Not

7

Financial institutions are defined very broadly under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to include all
businesses that are “significantly engaged” in providing financial products or services. This includes, for
example, check-cashing businesses, payday lenders, mortgage brokers, nonbank lenders, personal
property or real estate appraisers, and professional tax preparers.
8
Under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (“CFPA”), Title X of Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat.
1955 (July 21, 2010) (also known as the “Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act”), most of the FTC’s Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act rulemaking authority was transferred to the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The FTC retains enforcement authority under the Gramm-LeachBliley Act as well as rulemaking authority for the Safeguards Rule and limited rulemaking authority
under the Privacy Rule with respect to auto dealers.
9
Under the CFPA, the Commission shares its FCRA enforcement role with the CFPB, but rulemaking
authority transferred in large part to the CFPB (with the exception of the Red Flags and Disposal Rules).

Track practices, 14 a “Shine the Light” law requiring greater transparency for data brokers, 15 and
a law that mandates an “eraser button” allowing minors to request the deletion of certain social
media information. 16 Using these laws and other authorities, federal and state governments have
levied significant fines against companies that have failed to protect the privacy and security of
consumers’ personal information. 17
Private lawsuits have also led to successful judgments and settlements that provide
additional privacy and data security protection for consumers. For example, in 2015, Target
agreed to pay $10 million as part of a settlement with customers who claimed their personal
financial information was compromised by a widespread data breach. In 2013, AOL agreed to
pay a $5 million settlement to resolve a class action involving alleged inadequate deidentification related to the release of search queries of hundreds of thousands of AOL members.
Additionally, a federal court approved a $9 million payment by Netflix for allegedly keeping
rental history records in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988. Federal courts in
California approved two separate settlements with Facebook, one for $20 million and another for
$9.5 million, involving the company’s collection, use, and sharing of its users’ personal
information. And, in 2008, a California state court approved a $20 million settlement with
LensCrafters for unlawful disclosure of consumers’ medical information.
In sum, as this summary illustrates, the United States provides significant legal protection
for consumer privacy and security. The new Privacy Shield Framework, which ensures
meaningful safeguards for EU citizens, will operate against this larger backdrop in which the
protection of consumers’ privacy and security continues to be an important priority.

ATTACHMENT B

 

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC or Commission) is an independent U.S. law enforcement agency charged
with protecting consumers and enhancing competition across broad sectors of the economy. The FTC’s
primary legal authority comes from Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or
deceptive practices in the marketplace. The FTC also has authority to enforce a variety of sector specific laws,
including the Truth in Lending Act, the CAN-SPAM Act, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the
Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act. This broad authority allows the Commission to
address a wide array of practices affecting consumers, including those that emerge with the development of
new technologies and business models.

How Does the FTC Protect Consumer Privacy and Ensure Data Security?
The FTC uses a variety of tools to protect consumers’ privacy and personal information. The FTC’s principal
tool is to bring enforcement actions to stop law violations and require companies to take affirmative steps to
remediate the unlawful behavior. This includes, when appropriate, implementation of comprehensive privacy
and security programs, biennial assessments by independent experts, monetary redress to consumers,
disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, deletion of illegally obtained consumer information, and provision of robust
notice and choice mechanisms to consumers. If a company violates an FTC order, the FTC can seek civil
monetary penalties for the violations. The FTC can also obtain civil monetary penalties for violations of certain
privacy statutes and rules, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act,
and the Telemarketing Sales Rule. To date, the Commission has brought hundreds of privacy and data security
cases protecting billions of consumers.
The FTC’s other tools include conducting studies and issuing reports, hosting public workshops, developing
educational materials for consumers and businesses, testifying before the U.S. Congress and commenting on
legislative and regulatory proposals that affect consumer privacy, and working with international partners on
global privacy and accountability issues.
In all of its privacy work, the FTC’s goals have remained constant: to protect consumers’ personal information
and ensure that consumers have the confidence to take advantage of the many benefits offered in the
marketplace.

1

ENFORCEMENT
The FTC has unparalleled experience in consumer privacy enforcement. Its enforcement actions have
addressed practices offline, online, and in the mobile environment. It has brought enforcement actions against
well-known companies, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft, as well as lesser-known companies.
The FTC’s consumer privacy enforcement orders do not just protect American consumers; rather, they protect
consumers worldwide from unfair or deceptive practices by businesses within the FTC’s jurisdiction.

General Privacy
The FTC has brought enforcement actions addressing a wide range of privacy issues, including spam, social
networking, behavioral advertising, pretexting, spyware, peer-to-peer file sharing, and mobile. These matters
include over 130 spam and spyware cases and more than 50 general privacy lawsuits. In 2015, the FTC
announced the following privacy cases:
▶ The FTC alleged that defendant Craig Brittain, the operator of an alleged “revenge porn” website, used
deception to acquire and post intimate images of women, then referred them to another website he
controlled, where they were told they could have the pictures removed if they paid hundreds of
dollars. Under the settlement agreement, the defendant is banned from publicly sharing any more
nude videos or photographs of people without their affirmative express consent, and must destroy the
intimate images and personal contact information he collected while operating the site.
▶ The FTC granted summary judgment against the operators of Jerk.com, a
website that billed itself as “the anti-social network,” for deceiving users
about the source of content on the website. The Commission found that
the operators misled consumers by claiming that content on the website
was posted by other users. Instead, most of the content came from
Facebook profiles mined by the operators. The Commission also found
that the defendants misrepresented the benefits of a paid membership
which, for $30, purportedly allowed consumers to update information in their Jerk.com profiles. In
fact, consumers who paid for the membership were unable to correct information about them on the
site, and did not receive anything of value for their “membership.”
▶ Nomi Technologies, a company whose technology allows retailers to track consumers’ movements
through their stores, settled charges that it misled consumers with promises that it would provide an
in-store mechanism for consumers to opt out of tracking and that consumers would be informed when
locations were using Nomi’s tracking services. The complaint alleges that these promises were not
true because no in-store opt-out mechanism was available, and consumers were not informed when
the tracking was taking place.
▶ The FTC finalized its order against TRUSTe, Inc., a provider of privacy certifications for online
businesses. The FTC alleged that from 2006 until January 2013, TRUSTe failed to conduct annual
recertifications of companies holding TRUSTe privacy seals in over 1,000 incidences, despite
representing on its website that companies holding TRUSTe Certified Privacy Seals receive
recertification every year.
2

▶ The FTC approved final orders with health billing company PaymentsMD, LLC, and its former CEO,
Michael C. Hughes. The FTC charged that they misled thousands of consumers who signed up for an
online billing portal by failing to adequately inform them that the company would seek highly detailed
medical information from pharmacies, medical labs, and insurance companies.
▶ According to the FTC’s complaint, data broker Sequoia One bought payday loan applications of
financially strapped consumers, and then sold that information to a scam operation that took millions
of dollars from consumers by debiting their bank accounts and charging their credit cards without their
consent. As a result, fraudsters obtained the financial account information for more than 500,000
consumers and raided their accounts of at least $7.1 million.
▶ Two data brokers, Bayview Solutions and Cornerstone and Company, agreed to settle charges that they
exposed highly sensitive information – including bank account and credit card numbers, birth dates,
contact information, employers’ names, and information about debts the consumers allegedly owed –
about tens of thousands of consumers while trying to sell portfolios of consumer debt on a public
website. The agreements with the FTC require the defendants to abide by strict new requirements to
protect consumers’ sensitive information.
▶ CWB Services, LLC, the operators of a payday lending scheme, are banned from the consumer lending
business under settlements with the FTC. The FTC alleged the defendants used personal financial
information bought from data brokers to make unauthorized deposits into consumers’ bank accounts.
After depositing money into consumers’ accounts without their permission, the defendants withdrew
bi-weekly reoccurring “finance charges” without any of the payments going toward reducing the loan’s
principal. The defendants then contacted the consumers by phone and email, telling them that they
had agreed to, and were obligated to pay for, the “loan” they never requested and misrepresented the
true costs of the purported loans.
▶ The FTC reached a settlement with Pairsys, Inc., a company that allegedly tricked seniors and other
targeted populations into providing financial information to pay hundreds of dollars for technical
support services they did not need, as well as software that was otherwise available for free. Under
the terms of the agreement, the defendants are required to turn over multiple real estate properties
as well as the contents of numerous bank accounts, and to give up the leases on two luxury cars.
▶ The FTC obtained a preliminary injunction against Click4Support, LLC, a
tech support scam that allegedly bilked consumers out of more than $17
million by pretending to represent Microsoft, Apple and other major tech
companies. According to the complaint, the defendants used internet
advertisements and popups that appeared to be from well-known
technology companies to lure consumers into calling them. When
consumers called, they were further misled into thinking their computers
were riddled with viruses, malware, or security breaches. Consumers were then given a high-pressure
sales pitch for unnecessary technical support plans and repair services and defendants obtained their
payment information to charge hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars.
▶ Thousands of consumers downloaded the Prized Mobile app, believing they could earn points for
playing games or downloading affiliated apps and then spend those points on rewards such as clothes,
3

gift cards and other items. The defendant promised consumers that the downloaded app would be
free from malware and viruses. However, the FTC alleged that the app’s main purpose was actually to
load the consumers’ mobile phones with malicious software to mine virtual currencies for the
defendant. As part of the settlement, the defendant is banned from creating and distributing malicious
software, and must destroy all information about consumers collected through the marketing and
distribution of the app.

Data Security
Since 2002, the FTC has brought almost 60 cases against companies that have engaged in unfair or deceptive
practices that put consumers’ personal data at unreasonable risk. In 2015, the FTC brought the following
cases:
▶ Oracle agreed to settle charges that it deceived consumers about the security provided by updates to
its Java Platform, Standard Edition software (Java SE). According to the complaint, Oracle was aware of
significant security issues affecting older versions of Java SE that allowed hackers to craft malware that
could allow access to consumers’ usernames and passwords for financial accounts, and allow hackers
to acquire other sensitive information through phishing attacks. The FTC alleged that Oracle promised
consumers that by installing its updates to Java SE both the updates and the consumer’s system would
be “safe and secure,” yet failed to inform consumers that the Java SE update automatically removed
only the most recent prior version of the software, and did not remove any other earlier versions. As a
result, consumers could still have additional older, insecure versions of the software on their
computers that were vulnerable to being hacked. Under the order, Oracle is required to give
consumers the ability to easily uninstall insecure, older versions of Java SE.
▶ In Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, the Third Circuit affirmed the FTC’s authority to challenge unfair data
security practices using its Section 5 authority. The Third Circuit upheld the District Court’s ruling that
the FTC could use the prohibition on unfair practices in Section 5 of the FTC Act to challenge the
alleged data security lapses outlined in the complaint. The Court also rejected Wyndham’s argument
that it lacked fair notice that its practices could fall short of that provision.
▶ Wyndham Hotels and Resorts agreed to settle FTC charges that the
company’s security practices unfairly exposed the payment card
information of hundreds of thousands of consumers to hackers in three
separate data breaches. Under the terms of the settlement, the company
will establish a comprehensive information security program designed to
protect cardholder data – including payment card numbers, names and
expiration dates. In addition, the company is required to conduct annual information security audits
and maintain safeguards in connections between Wyndham’s and its franchisees’ servers.
▶ Lifelock agreed to pay $100 million to settle FTC contempt charges that it violated a 2010 settlement
with the agency and 35 state attorneys general by continuing to make deceptive claims about its
identity theft protection services, and by failing to take steps required to protect its users’ data.
Specifically, from at least October 2012 through March 2014, LifeLock allegedly violated the 2010
Order by failing to establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program to protect its
users’ sensitive personal data; falsely advertising that it protected consumers’ sensitive data with the
same high-level safeguards as financial institutions; and failing to meet the 2010 order’s recordkeeping
4

requirements. The FTC also asserts that from at least January 2012 through December 2014, LifeLock
falsely claimed it protected consumers’ identity 24/7/365 by providing alerts “as soon as” it received
any indication there was a problem.
▶ FTC staff sent a letter to Morgan Stanley closing its investigation into whether the company failed to
secure, in a reasonable and appropriate manner, account information related to Morgan Stanley’s
Wealth Management clients. As discussed in the letter, staff considered several factors in deciding to
close the investigation, including the fact that Morgan Stanley had established and implemented
comprehensive policies designed to protect against insider theft of personal information.

Credit Reporting & Financial Privacy
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) sets out rules for companies that use data to determine
creditworthiness, insurance eligibility, suitability for employment, and to screen tenants. The FTC has brought
over 100 FCRA cases against companies for credit-reporting problems and has collected over $30 million in
civil penalties. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley (“GLB”) Act requires financial institutions to send consumers annual
privacy notices and allow them to opt out of sharing their information with unaffiliated third parties. It also
requires financial institutions to implement reasonable security policies and procedures. Since 2005, the FTC
has brought almost 30 cases for violation of the GLB Act. In 2015, the FTC brought the following cases:
▶ Mobile service provider Sprint agreed to pay $2.95 million in civil penalties
to settle allegations that the company failed to give proper notice to
consumers who were placed in a program for customers with lower credit
scores and charged an extra monthly fee. The complaint alleges that
Sprint in many cases failed to provide consumers placed in the program
with all of the disclosures required by the Risk-Based Pricing Rule, omitting
required information that would help consumers understand the
information in their credit reports, and that may have alerted them to possible errors that caused them
to receive less favorable terms of credit. In addition, the complaint alleges that Sprint often provided
these notices to consumers after the window in which they could cancel their service without paying
an early termination fee, leaving consumers unable to shop for another carrier that may offer them
better terms.
▶ The loan-servicing arm of Texas-based auto dealer Tricolor Auto Acceptance, LLC agreed to pay over
$82,000 in civil penalties as part of a settlement to address charges that it violated the FCRA’s
Furnisher Rule, which requires companies that report information about consumers to consumer
reporting agencies (CRAs) to maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure that the information
they report is accurate and to allow consumers to dispute inaccurate information with the company.
While the defendant provides information on thousands of consumers to one CRA, the FTC’s complaint
alleged that the defendant had no written policies or procedures addressing how to ensure the
accuracy of that information. The complaint further alleges that when consumers disputed the
accuracy of the information provided by the defendant to the CRA, the defendant referred them back
to the CRA instead of conducting an investigation as required under the Rule.

U.S.-EU Safe Harbor
The FTC has enforced the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, which was implemented in 2000 to facilitate the
transfer of personal data from Europe to the United States. The FTC brought a number of new cases this year
against companies that violated Section 5 of the FTC Act by making misrepresentations about their
participation in the program. It also issued final orders against several companies that had previously violated
their Safe Harbor promises. In total, the FTC has used Section 5 to bring 39 Safe Harbor cases since 2009.
During the past year, the FTC brought the following cases:
▶ The FTC issued final orders against two U.S. businesses, TES Franchising, LLC, and American
International Mailing, Inc., falsely claiming to abide by the Safe Harbor. The FTC’s complaints alleged
that the companies’ websites indicated they were currently certified under the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor
Framework and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, when in fact their certifications had lapsed years
earlier.
▶ Thirteen companies agreed to settle FTC charges that they misled consumers by claiming they were
certified members of the U.S.-EU or U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks when their certifications had
lapsed or the companies had never applied for membership in the program at all. Seven of the
companies allegedly violated the FTC Act by falsely claiming to have a current certification in one or
both safe harbor programs when their certifications had actually not been renewed. The companies
are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Golf Connect, LLC
Pinger, Inc.
NAICS Association, LLC
Jubilant Clinsys, Inc.
IOActive, Inc.
Contract Logix, LLC
Forensics Consulting Solutions, LLC

Six of the companies allegedly violated the FTC Act by claiming certification in one or both safe harbor
programs when they never actually applied for membership in the programs. The companies are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Dale Jarrett Racing Adventure, Inc.
SteriMed Medical Waste Solutions
Jhayrmaine Daniels (California Skate Line)
Just Bagels Manufacturing, Inc.
One Industries Corp.

▶ The FTC’s final order against TRUSTe, Inc. prohibits the company from making misrepresentations
about its certification process or timeline. While the FTC’s case, discussed above, did not allege any
Safe Harbor violations, the order applies to all of TRUSTe’s certification programs, and explicitly
includes its U.S.-EU Safe Harbor certification work.
On October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice issued a judgment declaring as invalid the European
Commission’s Decision 2000/520/EC of 26 July 2000 on the adequacy of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework.

U.S. and EU officials are currently discussing the development of an enhanced mechanism that protects
privacy and provides an alternative method for transatlantic data transfers.

Children’s Privacy
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”) generally
requires websites and apps to obtain parental consent before collecting personal
information from children under 13. Since 2000, the FTC has brought over 20
COPPA cases and collected millions of dollars in civil penalties. In 2013, the FTC
updated it regulatory rule that implements COPPA to address new developments
– such as social networking, smartphone Internet access, and the ability to use
geolocation information – that affect children’s privacy. (The new rule went into effect July 1, 2013). During
the past year, the Commission brought the following cases:
▶ The FTC approved Riyo Inc.’s proposal for a new COPPA verifiable parental consent method. Riyo uses
a two-step process called “face match to verified photo identification” to verify that the person
providing consent for a child to use an online service is in fact the child’s parent. In the first step, a
parent provides an image of their photo identification, such as a passport or driver’s license, which is
verified for authenticity using various technologies. In a second step, the parent is then prompted to
provide a picture of themselves taken with a phone or web camera, which is analyzed to confirm that
the photo is of a live person and not a photo of a still photo. The image is then compared to the
identification photo using facial recognition technology to confirm whether the person submitting the
photo is the one in the identification. The process includes certain privacy safeguards such as requiring
encryption and prompt deletion of any personal information that is collected.
▶ In its complaint against app developer LAI Systems, the FTC alleged that the company created a
number of apps directed to children, and allowed third-party advertisers to collect personal
information from children in the form of persistent identifiers. The defendant failed to inform the ad
networks that the apps were directed to children and did not provide notice or obtain consent from
children’s parents for collecting and using the information. The settlement with LAI Systems prohibits
the company from further violations of the COPPA Rule, and requires the company to pay a $60,000
civil penalty.
▶ App developer Retro Dreamer and its principals agreed to pay $300,000 in civil penalties to settle
charges that they violated COPPA. The FTC alleged that the company created a number of apps
targeted to children and allowed third-party advertisers to collect children’s personal information in
the form of persistent identifiers through the apps. One advertising network over the course of 2013
and 2014 specifically warned the defendants about the obligations of the revised COPPA Rule, and also
told the defendants that certain of their apps appeared to be targeted to children under the age of 13.

Do Not Call
In 2003, the FTC amended the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) to create a national
Do Not Call Registry, which now includes more than 222 million active
registrations. Do Not Call provisions prohibit sellers and telemarketers from
engaging in certain abusive practices that infringe on a consumer’s right to be left
alone, including calling an individual whose number is listed with the Do Not Call
Registry, calling consumers after they have asked not to be called again, and using
robocalls to contact consumers to sell goods or services. Since 2003, the FTC has brought 122 cases enforcing
Do Not Call Provisions against telemarketers. Through these enforcement actions, the Commission has
sought civil penalties, monetary restitution for victims of telemarketing scams, and disgorgement of ill-gotten
gains from the 384 companies and 306 individuals involved. Although a number of cases remain in litigation,
the 114 cases that have concluded thus far have resulted in orders totaling more than $144 million in civil
penalties and over $1 billion in redress or disgorgement. During the past year, the Commission brought the
following cases:
▶ The FTC filed a complaint against Lifewatch Inc., claiming that the company used blatantly illegal and
deceptive robocalls to trick older consumers throughout the United States and Canada into signing up
for medical alert systems with monthly monitoring fees ranging from $29.95 to $39.95. Litigation in
this matter is ongoing.
▶ At the FTC’s request, a federal district court temporarily halted the activities of Orlando-based All Us
Marketing LLC (formerly known as Payless Solutions, LLC). According to the FTC’s complaint, the
company has been bombarding consumers since 2011 with massive robocall campaigns designed to
trick them into paying up-front for worthless credit card interest rate reduction programs. The court
order stops the illegal calls, many of which targeted seniors and claimed to be from “credit card
services” and “card member services.” The defendants charged consumers up to $4,999 for their nonexistent services.
▶ The FTC and 10 state attorneys general sued a Florida cruise company – Caribbean Cruise Line, Inc. –
and its lead generators for illegally sending billions of political survey robocalls to sell cruise vacations.
The cruise company and the lead generators have agreed to consent judgments totaling more than $13
million. Those settlements are awaiting court approval.
▶ In Money Now Funding, LLC, the FTC took action against defendants who used illegal telemarketing
calls to cheat American and Canadian consumers out of more than $7 million in a business opportunity
scheme. The FTC obtained final judgments that banned the defendants from selling business and
work-at-home opportunities and resolved charges that the defendants conned consumers into thinking
they could make money by referring merchants in their area to a non-existent money-lending service.
Many victims affected by this scam were seniors with limited income and savings.
▶ A federal court imposed a $1.7 million judgment against three defendants who took part in the
Treasure Your Success scheme that used calls to numbers on the Do Not Call Registry and illegal
robocalls to pitch bogus credit card interest rate reduction services to consumers struggling with debt.
▶ At the FTC’s request, a federal court imposed a $3.4 million judgment against Jason Abraham, a repeat
offender, and his company Instant Response Systems, for engaging in a telemarketing scheme that
8

used deception, threats, and intimidation to induce elderly consumers to pay for medical alert systems
they neither ordered nor wanted. The FTC alleged that defendants illegally placed calls to numbers on
the Do Not Call Registry to reach elderly consumers – many of whom are in poor health and rely on
others for help with managing their finances – and pressure them into buying a medical alert service.
▶ As part of its settlement with Centro Natural Corp., the FTC obtained an order banning the defendants
from the debt collection business and telemarketing. According to the FTC’s complaint, the defendants
cold-called consumers and threatened them with harsh consequences, such as arrest, legal actions,
and immigration status investigations, if they failed to make large payments on bogus debts. The
defendants’ telemarketers also pressured and deceived consumers into paying for unwanted products
by telling consumers they would “settle” their debt. Centro also regularly cold-called consumers
whose phone numbers were on the Do Not Call Registry.
▶ In Sun Bright Ventures LLC, the FTC obtained a federal court order that
stopped a telemarketing scam that tricked senior citizens into disclosing
their bank account numbers by pretending to be Medicare and falsely
promising new Medicare cards. The scheme took millions of dollars from
victims’ bank accounts without their consent. Under settlements with the
FTC, the defendants were banned from selling healthcare-related products
and services.
▶ In its case against First Consumers, a federal court permanently barred the ringleader of a multi-million
dollar fraud that targeted seniors from all telemarketing activities, agreeing with the FTC’s allegations
that he violated the FTC Act and the TSR when he illegally withdrew money from U.S. consumers’
accounts and funneled it across the border to Canada. Telemarketers who carried out the fraud
allegedly impersonated government and bank officials, and enticed consumers to disclose their
confidential bank account information in order to facilitate the fraud. The defendants then used that
account information to create checks drawn on the consumers’ bank accounts and deposit them into
corporate accounts they established.
▶ The FTC announced the winner of its Robocalls: Humanity Strikes Back contest, awarding a $25,000
cash prize to Robokiller, a mobile app that blocks and forwards robocalls to a crowd-sourced honeypot.
This is the fourth contest issued by the agency to challenge technologists to design tools to block
robocalls and help investigators track down and stop the people behind them.

ADVOCACY
When courts, government offices, or other organizations consider cases or policy decisions that affect
consumers or competition, the FTC may provide its expertise and advocate for policies that protect consumers
and promote competition. In 2015, the FTC filed the following comments related to privacy issues:
▶ In a letter to the court-appointed consumer privacy ombudsman for the RadioShack Bankruptcy
proceeding, Bureau Director Jessica Rich recommended conditions the court could place on the sale of
consumers’ personal information to protect their privacy. Specifically, the letter, among other things,
recommended that consumers’ information not be sold as a standalone asset, but be bundled with
other assets. The letter also recommended that consumer information be sold only to another entity
that is in substantially the same line of business as RadioShack; that the buyer agree to be bound by
the RadioShack privacy policies that were in place when the consumers’ data was collected; and that
the buyer provide consumers with notice and obtain their affirmative consent before using data in a
way that is materially different from the promises RadioShack made.
▶ In January 2015, FTC staff submitted a response to the FCC’s request for public comment on whether
there are legal or regulatory prohibitions that prevent telephone carriers from offering call-blocking
technology. The FTC staff comment outlined the vital need for call-blocking technologies as an integral
component to providing subscribers with relief from illegal unwanted calls, and indicated its view that
no legal impediments existed to prevent the provision of such services to subscribers.
▶ In testimony before Congress, the FTC provided feedback on proposed data security legislation
pending before the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee. The testimony highlighted the Commission’s support for data security
legislation overall, and it noted elements of the proposed bill supported by the Commission as well as
areas where members of the Commission see room for improvement.
▶ The FTC highlighted to Congress its multi-faceted approach to protecting consumers from unwanted
telemarketing calls and illegal robocalls in testimony before the U.S. Senate Special Committee on
Aging. The testimony describes how the FTC uses every tool at its disposal to fight illegal robocalls,
including aggressive law enforcement, crowdsourcing technical solutions, and robust consumer and
business outreach.
▶ In its testimony to the Senate Special Committee on Aging, the FTC described its work to fight tech
support scammers who trick people into believing their computer has problems, and then charge them
hundreds of dollars for unnecessary, worthless, or even harmful services. The testimony outlined
aggressive FTC law enforcement, including work with officials in other countries, and the agency’s
efforts to educate consumers.
▶ The FTC provided feedback on proposed legislation before the Subcommittee on Commerce,
Manufacturing and Trade of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to address privacy and
security concerns around the growth of so-called “connected cars.” In particular, the testimony stated
that the proposed legislation could substantially weaken the security and privacy protections that
consumers have today.
10

RULES
As directed by Congress, the FTC has authority to develop rules that regulate
specific areas of consumer privacy and security. Since 2000, the FTC has
promulgated rules in a number of these areas:
▶ The Health Breach Notification Rule requires certain Web-based
businesses to notify consumers when the security of their electronic health
information is breached.
▶ The Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions and certain creditors to have identity theft prevention
programs to identify, detect, and respond to patterns, practices, or specific activities that could
indicate identity theft.
▶ The COPPA Rule requires websites and apps to get parental consent before collecting personal
information from kids under 13. The Rule was revised in 2013 to strengthen kids’ privacy protections
and gives parents greater control over the personal information that websites and online services may
collect from children under 13.
▶ The GLB Privacy Rule sets forth when car dealerships must provide a consumer with a notice explaining
the institution’s privacy policies and practices and provide a consumer with an opportunity to opt out
of, disclosures of certain information to nonaffiliated third parties. In 2015, the FTC proposed an
amendment to the GLB Privacy Rule to allow auto dealers that finance car purchases or provide car
leases to provide online updates to consumers about their privacy policies as opposed to sending
yearly updates by mail.
▶ The GLB Safeguards Rule requires financial institutions over which the FTC has jurisdiction to develop,
implement, and maintain a comprehensive information security program that contains administrative,
technical, and physical safeguards.
▶ The Telemarking Sales Rule requires telemarketers to make specific disclosures of material
information; prohibits misrepresentations; limits the hours that telemarketers may call consumers; and
sets payment restrictions for the sale of certain goods and services. Do Not Call provisions of the Rule
prohibit sellers and telemarketers from engaging in certain abusive practices that infringe on a
consumer’s right to be left alone, including calling an individual whose number is listed with the Do Not
Call Registry or who has asked not to receive telemarking calls from a particular company. The Rule
also prohibits robocalls – prerecorded commercial telemarketing calls to consumers –unless the
telemarketer has obtained permission in writing from consumers who want to receive such calls. In
2015, following a public comment period, the Commission approved several amendments to the
Telemarketing Sales Rule, including a prohibition on four discrete types of payment methods favored
by con artists and scammers. The TSR changes stop telemarketers from dipping directly into consumer
bank accounts by using certain kinds of checks and “payment orders” that have been “remotely
created” by the telemarketer or seller. In addition, the amendments bar telemarketers from receiving
payments through traditional “cash-to-cash” money transfers. The TSR changes also prohibit
telemarketers from accepting as payment “cash reload” mechanisms.
11

▶ The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Rule is designed
to protect consumers from deceptive commercial email and requires companies to have opt out
mechanisms in place.
▶ The Disposal Rule under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACTA”), which
amended the FCRA, requires that companies dispose of credit reports and information derived from
them in a safe and secure manner.
▶ The Pre-screen Opt-out Rule under FACTA requires companies that send “prescreened” solicitations of
credit or insurance to consumers to provide simple and easy-to-understand notices that explain
consumers’ right to opt out of receiving future offers.

12

WORKSHOPS
Beginning in 1996, the FTC has hosted over 35 workshops, town halls, and roundtables bringing together
stakeholders to discuss emerging issues in consumer privacy and security. In 2015, the FTC hosted the
following privacy events:
▶ The FTC held a workshop entitled Follow the Lead to explore online lead
generation in various industries, including lending and education.
Consumer “leads” sometimes contain sensitive personal and financial
information that may travel through multiple online marketing entities
before connecting with the desired businesses. The workshop examined
the consumer protection issues raised by the practices of the lead
generation industry, and what consumers and businesses should know and
do to address them.
▶ The FTC hosted a workshop on cross-device tracking to examine the privacy and security issues around
the tracking of consumers’ activities across their different devices for advertising and marketing
purposes.

13

REPORTS AND SURVEYS
The FTC is a leader in developing policy recommendations related to consumer privacy and data security. The
FTC has authored over 50 reports, based on independent research as well as workshop submissions and
discussions, in a number of areas involving privacy and security. In 2015, the FTC released the following:
▶ FTC staff issued a report on the Internet of Things that discusses how the
principles of security, data minimization, notice, and choice apply in this
developing marketplace. The report recommends a series of concrete
steps that businesses can take to enhance and protect consumers’ privacy
and security, as consumers start to reap the benefits from a growing world
of Internet-connected devices.
▶ The FTC issued a follow-up study of credit report accuracy that found most consumers who previously
reported an unresolved error on one of their three major credit reports believe that at least one piece
of disputed information on their report is still inaccurate. The congressionally mandated study is the
sixth and final study on national credit report accuracy by the FTC.
▶ FTC staff released the results of its third kids’ app survey in a blog. This follow-up survey examined
what information kids’ app developers are collecting from users, whom they are sharing it with, and
what disclosures they are providing to parents about their practices.

14

CONSUMER EDUCATION AND BUSINESS GUIDANCE
Educating businesses and consumers about privacy and data security issues – and how to address related
threats – is critical to the FTC’s mission. The Commission has distributed millions of copies of educational
materials for consumers and businesses to address ongoing threats to security and privacy. The FTC has
developed extensive materials providing guidance on a range of topics, such as identity theft, Internet safety
for children, mobile privacy, credit reporting, behavioral advertising, Do Not Call, and computer security.
Examples of such education and guidance materials released in 2015 include:
▶ The FTC introduced IdentityTheft.gov (robodeidentidad.gov in Spanish), a
new resource to help identity theft victims determine which critical steps
to take first. It has detailed advice and helpful resources, including easyto-print checklists and sample letters. The site also helps users connect to
organizations that are critical to recovery: credit bureaus, the Social
Security Administration, the IRS and local consumer protection offices.
▶ The FTC launched its Start with Security campaign to provide businesses with more information on data
security and help them protect consumers’ information. The initiative includes: new online and print
guidance that draws on lessons learned in more than 50 FTC data security cases; a series of
conferences to provide practical tips and strategies to help startups and developers implement
effective data security; a set of videos that illustrate the lessons of Start with Security; and a website
that consolidates the FTC’s data security information for businesses.
▶ The FTC’s consumer and OnGuardOnline blogs alert consumers to potential privacy and data security
harms, and offer tips to help them protect their information. In 2015, popular blog posts addressed:
data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management; tech support scams; protecting children’s
information after a data breach; coping with a healthcare records breach; and new FTC videos about
responding to hacked email or an infected computer.
▶ The FTC’s Business Blog addresses recent enforcement actions, reports, and guidance. Recent blogs
about privacy and data security covered: tips for businesses on how the Fair Credit Reporting Act
applies to the hiring process; easy-to-implement suggestions for password security; what to expect if a
business is the subject of an FTC data security investigation; and considerations for companies using
consumer-generated health data.
▶ The FTC also hosts a Technology Blog to discuss some of the more technical aspects of the agency’s
work. For example, last year the FTC posted a series on privacy and security in mobile computing,
discussing secure application programming interface (API) design, permission-based access controls,
and improving permissions systems.

15

INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT
A key part of the FTC’s privacy work is engaging with international partners. The agency works closely with
foreign privacy authorities, international organizations, and global privacy networks to develop robust mutual
enforcement cooperation on privacy and data security investigations and cases. The FTC also plays a lead role
in advocating for strong, globally interoperable privacy protections for consumers around the world.

Enforcement Cooperation
The FTC cooperates on enforcement matters with its foreign counterparts through informal consultations,
memoranda of understanding, complaint sharing, and mechanisms developed pursuant to the U.S. SAFE WEB
Act, which authorizes the FTC to share information with foreign law enforcement authorities and provide
them with investigative assistance by using the agency’s statutory powers to obtain evidence in appropriate
cases. During 2015, the FTC took several steps to enhance privacy enforcement cooperation:
▶ The FTC joined with privacy agencies from seven countries to launch a new information-sharing system
– GPEN Alert – that enables participants to share confidential information about investigations and
better coordinate international enforcement efforts. The participants are members of the Global
Privacy Enforcement Network (GPEN), an informal network of 59 privacy agencies that promotes crossborder cooperation. In addition to the FTC, the initial participants in the GPEN Alert system are: the
Office of the Australian Information Commissioner; Canada’s Office of the Privacy Commissioner;
Ireland’s Office of the Data Protection Commissioner; the Netherlands’ Data Protection Authority; New
Zealand’s Office of the Privacy Commissioner; Norway’s Data Protection Authority; and the United
Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office.
▶ The FTC also participated in the 2015 GPEN Sweep, along with 28 other privacy enforcement
authorities. The sweep centered on the privacy practices of websites and apps popular among kids.
The FTC conducted a follow-up survey that examined what information kids’ app developers are
collecting from users, whom they are sharing it with, and what disclosures they are providing to
parents about their practices.
▶ In a Memorandum of Understanding with the Dutch Data Protection Authority, the FTC and the Dutch
authority agreed voluntarily to engage in mutual assistance and the exchange of information in
connection with the enforcement of applicable privacy laws.

16

Policy
The FTC advocates for sound policies that ensure strong privacy protections for consumer data that is
transferred outside the United States and across other national borders. It also works to promote global
interoperability among privacy regimes and better accountability from businesses involved in data transfers.
During the past year, the FTC played a lead role in these international efforts:
▶ The FTC participated in the finalization of the APEC Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) program,
through which data processors can be recognized as meeting the privacy obligations of data controllers
certified under the Cross-Border Privacy Rules System.
▶ The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) released an update to its 2002
Recommendations on Digital Security. The FTC, together with other U.S. agencies and stakeholders,
participated actively in revising the recommendation, which specifically calls for cross-border
cooperation on digital security risk management.
▶ The FTC participated in transatlantic discussions on improvements to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor
Framework and pursued cases to enforce companies’ Safe Harbor commitments. Following an October
decision by the European Court of Justice declaring as invalid the European Commission’s Decision
2000/520/EC of 26 July 2000 on the adequacy of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, the FTC
continued to participate in negotiations, together with the Department of Commerce and other U.S.
agencies, to develop an enhanced mechanism to protect privacy and provide an alternative method for
transatlantic data transfers.
▶ Other international engagement included participation at the Asia-Pacific Privacy Authorities Forum;
the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners; and the OECD. The FTC
also engaged directly with numerous counterparts, including hosting privacy officials from Japan and
Korea as part of the State Department’s International Visitor Leadership Program, and holding a
workshop on privacy enforcement cooperation with consumer authorities in Brazil.

Mr. Ted Dean

Dear Mr. Antonipillai and Mr. Dean:
This letter provides a brief overview of the primary investigative tools used to obtain
commercial data and other record information from corporations in the United States for criminal
law enforcement or public interest (civil and regulatory) purposes, including the access
limitations set forth in those authorities.1 These legal processes are nondiscriminatory in that
they are used to obtain information from corporations in the United States, including from
companies that will self-certify through the US/EU Privacy Shield framework, without regard to
the nationality of the data subject. Further, corporations that receive legal process in the United
States may challenge it in court as discussed below.'
Of particular note with respect to the seizure of data by public authorities is the Fourth
Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provides that "Nile right of the people to
This overview does not describe the national security investigative tools used by law enforcement in terrorism and
other national security investigations, including National Security Letters (NSLs) for certain record information in
credit reports, financial records, and electronic subscriber and transaction records, see 12 U.S.C. § 3414; 15 U.S.C. §
1681u; 15 U.S.C. § 1681v; 18 U.S.C. § 2709, and for electronic surveillance, search warrants, business records, and
other collection of communications pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, see 50 U.S.C. § 1801 et
seq.

This paper discusses federal law enforcement and regulatory authorities; violations of state law are investigated by
states and are tried in state courts. State law enforcement authorities use warrants and subpoenas issued under state
law in essentially the same manner as described herein, but with the possibility that state legal process may be
subject to protections provided by State constitutions that exceed those of the U.S. Constitution. State law
protections must be at least equal to those of the U.S. Constitution, including but not limited to the Fourth
Amendment.

be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and
seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported
by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or
things to be seized." U.S. Const. amend. IV. As the United States Supreme Court stated in
Berger v. State of New York, "Mlle basic purpose of this Amendment, as recognized in countless
decisions of this Court, is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary
invasions by government officials." 388 U.S. 41, 53 (1967) (citing Camara v. Mun. Court of San
Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, 528 (1967)). In domestic criminal investigations, the Fourth
Amendment generally requires law enforcement officers to obtain a court-issued warrant before
conducting a search. See Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357 (1967). When the warrant
requirement does not apply, government activity is subject to a "reasonableness" test under the
Fourth Amendment. The Constitution itself, therefore, ensures that the U.S. government does
not have limitless, or arbitrary, power to seize private information.
Criminal Law Enforcement Authorities:
Federal prosecutors, who are officials of the Department of Justice (D0J), and federal
investigative agents including agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a law
enforcement agency within DOJ, are able to compel production of documents and other record
information from corporations in the United States for criminal investigative purposes through
several types of compulsory legal processes, including grand jury subpoenas, administrative
subpoenas, and search warrants, and may acquire other communications pursuant to federal
criminal wiretap and pen register authorities.
Grand Jury or Trial Subpoenas: Criminal subpoenas are used to support targeted law
enforcement investigations. A grand jury subpoena is an official request issued from a grand
jury (usually at the request of a federal prosecutor) to support a grand jury investigation into a
particular suspected violation of criminal law. Grand juries are an investigative arm of the court
and are impaneled by a judge or magistrate. A subpoena may require someone to testify at a
proceeding, or to produce or make available business records, electronically stored information,
or other tangible items. The information must be relevant to the investigation and the subpoena
cannot be unreasonable because it is overbroad, or because it is oppressive or burdensome. A
recipient can file a motion to challenge a subpoena based on those grounds. See Fed. R. Crim. P.
17. In limited circumstances, trial subpoenas for documents may be used after the case has been
indicted by the grand jury.
Administrative Subpoena Authority: Administrative subpoena authorities may be
exercised in criminal or civil investigations. In the criminal law enforcement context, several
federal statutes authorize the use of administrative subpoenas to produce or make available
business records, electronically stored information, or other tangible items in investigations
involving health care fraud, child abuse, Secret Service protection, controlled substance cases,
and Inspector General investigations implicating government agencies. If the government seeks
to enforce an administrative subpoena in court, the recipient of the administrative subpoena, like
the recipient of a grand jury subpoena, can argue that the subpoena is unreasonable because it is
overbroad, or because it is oppressive or burdensome.

3
Court Orders For Pen Register and Trap and Traces: Under criminal pen register and
trap-and-trace provisions, law enforcement may obtain a court order to acquire real-time, noncontent dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information about a phone number or email
upon certification that the information provided is relevant to a pending criminal investigation.
See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-3127. The use or installation of such a device outside the law is a federal
crime.
Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA): Additional rules govern the
government's access to subscriber information, traffic data, and stored content of
communications held by ISPs, telephone companies, and other third-party service providers,
pursuant to Title II of ECPA, also called the Stored Communications Act (SCA), 18 U.S.C. §§
2701-2712. The SCA sets forth a system of statutory privacy rights that limit law enforcement
access to data beyond what is required under constitutional law from customers and subscribers
of Internet service providers. The SCA provides for increasing levels of privacy protections
depending on the intrusiveness of the collection. For subscriber registration information, IP
addresses and associated time stamps, and billing information, criminal law enforcement
authorities must obtain a subpoena. For most other stored, non-content information, such as
email headers without the subject line, law enforcement must present specific facts to a judge
demonstrating that the requested information is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal
investigation. To obtain the stored content of electronic communications, generally, criminal
law enforcement authorities obtain a warrant from a judge based on probable cause to believe the
account in question contains evidence of a crime. The SCA also provides for civil liability and
criminal penalties.
Court Orders for Surveillance Pursuant to Federal Wiretap Law: Additionally, law
enforcement may intercept in real time wire, oral, or electronic communications for criminal
investigative purposes pursuant to the federal wiretap law. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2522. This
authority is available only pursuant to a court order in which a judge finds, inter alia, that there is
probable cause to believe that the wiretap or electronic interception will produce evidence of a
federal crime, or the whereabouts of a fugitive fleeing from prosecution. The statute provides for
civil liability and criminal penalties for violations of the wiretapping provisions.
Search Warrant — Rule 41: Law enforcement can physically search premises in the
United States when authorized to do so by a judge. Law enforcement must demonstrate to the
judge based on a showing of "probable cause" that a crime was committed or is about to be
committed and that items connected to the crime are likely to be found in the place specified by
the warrant. This authority is often used when a physical search by police of a premise is needed
due to the danger that evidence may be destroyed if a subpoena or other production order is
served on the corporation. See U.S. Const. amend. IV (discussed in further detail above); Fed. R.
Crim. P. 41. The subject of a search wanant may move to quash the warrant as overbroad,
vexatious, or otherwise improperly obtained, and aggrieved parties with standing may move to
suppress any evidence obtained in an unlawful search. See Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961).
DOJ Guidelines and Policies: In addition to these Constitutional, statutory, and rulebased limitations on government access to data, the Attorney General has issued guidelines that
place further limits on law enforcement access to data, and that also contain privacy and civil

4
liberty protections. For instance, the Attorney General's Guidelines for Domestic Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Operations (September 2008) (hereinafter AG FBI Guidelines),
available at http://wwvv.justice.gov/archive/opa/docs/guidelines.pdf, set limits on use of
investigative means to seek information related to investigations that involve federal crimes.
These guidelines require that the FBI use the least intrusive investigative methods feasible,
taking into account the effect on privacy and civil liberties and the potential damage to
reputation. Further, they note that "it is axiomatic that the FBI must conduct its investigations
and other activities in a lawful and reasonable manner that respects liberty and privacy and
avoids unnecessary intrusions into the lives of law-abiding people." See AG FBI Guidelines at
5. The FBI has implemented these guidelines through the FBI Domestic Investigations and
Operations Guide (DIOG), available at https://vault.tbi.gov/FBI%20Domestic%20Investigations
%20and%200perations%20Guide%20(DIOG), a comprehensive manual that includes detailed
limits on use of investigative tools and guidance to assure that civil liberties and privacy are
protected in every investigation. Additional rules and policies that prescribe limitations on the
investigative activities of federal prosecutors are set out in the United States Attorneys' Manual
(USAM), also available online at http://wvvvv.justice.gov/usam/united-states-attorneys-manual
Civil and Regulatory Authorities (Public Interest):
There are also significant limits on civil or regulatory (i.e., "public interest") access to
data held by corporations in the United States. Agencies with civil and regulatory
responsibilities may issue subpoenas to corporations for business records, electronically stored
information, or other tangible items. These agencies are limited in their exercise of
administrative or civil subpoena authority not only by their organic statutes, but also by
•independent judicial review of subpoenas prior to potential judicial enforcement. See, e.g., Fed.
R. Civ. P. 45. Agencies may seek access only to data that is relevant to matters within their
scope of authority to regulate. Further, a recipient of an administrative subpoena may challenge
the enforcement of that subpoena in court by presenting evidence that the agency has not acted in
accordance with basic standards of reasonableness, as discussed earlier.
There are other legal bases for companies to challenge data requests from administrative
agencies based on their specific industries and the types of data they possess. For example,
financial institutions can challenge administrative subpoenas seeking certain types of information
as violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations. See 31 U.S.C. § 5318;
31 C.F.R. Part X. Other businesses can rely on the Fair Credit Reporting Act, see 15 U.S.C. §
1681b, or a host of other sector specific laws. Misuse of an agency's subpoena authority can
result in agency liability, or personal liability for agency officers. See, e.g., Right to Financial
Privacy Act, 12 U.S.C. §§ 3401-3422. Courts in the United States thus stand as the guardians
against improper regulatory requests and provide independent oversight of federal agency
actions.
Finally, any statutory power that administrative authorities have to physically seize
records from a company in the United States pursuant to an administrative search must meet the
requirements of the Fourth Amendment. See See v. City of Seattle, 387 U.S. 541 (1967).

Conclusion:
All law enforcement and regulatory activities in the United States must conform to
applicable law, including the U.S. Constitution, statutes, rules, and regulations. Such activities
must also comply with applicable policies, including any Attorney General Guidelines governing
federal law enforcement activities. The legal framework described above limits the ability of
U.S. law enforcement and regulatory agencies to acquire information from corporations in the
United States -- whether the information concerns U.S. persons or citizens of foreign countries -and in addition permits judicial review of any government requests for data pursuant to these
authorities.
